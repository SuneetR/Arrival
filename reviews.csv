"I have really long hair, but kind of of the thinner side. I‚Äôve been wanting something that gives volume & this does it. It‚Äôs easy to use and works quicker than my hairdryer. I like that it‚Äôs two pieces so it fits in my drawer better. The noise is to be expected, it‚Äôs a dryer. I found it‚Äôs easier to get the volume I want while flipping my hair upside down since it‚Äôs so long.",1 
"I finally decided to order this hair dryer. I tried it out yesterday and it works so good. The cool and high settings are the loudest, but the low setting isn't too loud. It did my hair extremely well and curled it too. Since it summer, my hair got puffy again immediately. I'll have to try again in the winter. It's very lightweight for the size. I thought it would be heavy but, it wasn't. Hopefully it lasts long",1 
"This dryer is awesome! I purchased it for my daughter and decided to try it out first. I love it!‚ù§Ô∏è It cuts our hair drying time down significantly. It's easy to use and powerful. I recommend trying it you won't be disappointed!",1 
"I really like this brush, it saves a lot of time. I have lots and thick hair, l used to spend like 30 minutes to do my hair but with this brush it dries supe fast, gives a lot of volume. You need to use so heat protector as the heat is pretty intense but medium speed will do it. You be will done in 10 minutes or less. Pretty convenient to travel as it comes is 2 parts so easy to pack. Really happy with it.",1 
"I loved this blow dryer for its simplicity and ease of use. I‚Äôd use it every week on wash day and for incredible results. But then I started noticing my hair was thinning and eventually a large section of it looked as though it was fried. I realize that the metal used in between the bristles was getting so hot that it was burning my hair and overtime eventually led to major hair loss. I had to chop my hair in order to stimulate regrowth and have been on the road to healthy hair recovery since. If you care and love your tresses, please go the old fashioned route with a roller brush and conventional dryer to control distance and heat exposure. It‚Äôs more work but if something feels too good to be true it most likely is!",1 
"I‚Äôve been looking at this brand for a while. When I say I‚Äôve tried it all I truly have. Drugstore to super high end and back again even trying custom and prescription hair care. Cream, lotion, potion, gel, serum I‚Äôve had it. I have 2a-c fine colored hair. So I tried this product after I‚Äôve sworn off any more. This has been the best product for my hair. Minimal fragrance, hair looks natural and fresh. I got the wavy formula. I‚Äôve got several compliments from people on my hair since using this product. My waves are a bit looser after a day and second day could use a refresh or wear looser pattern hairstyles. It‚Äôs not sticky at all and my hair feels soft and not like there is product in it at all. Zero frizz and I live in Florida. Buy it. It‚Äôs my new go to product. Finally",1
"Did not seem like the original brand, I‚Äôve bought this before through the main company and it worked great. Buy it from Amazon know it seems like they just put a new product inside the bottle because made my hair so horrible. I have naturally curly hair and I‚Äôve used this brand before and it worked wonders no this time it made my hair frizzy And dry and did not do what it was supposed to".,1 8."i have long, thick and fine hair and this doesn‚Äôt really do anything for me by itself not that i expected it to, i used two other products with it and it still doesn‚Äôt do much. probably better for thin and short hair!",1 8."It did enhance curls, but not any more so than a less expensive option. Didn‚Äôt care for the texture of my hair after it was dry‚Ä¶ felt gunky.",0 
"Did not work how I thought it would, my hair still looks crazy after it dries, looks like when I don‚Äôt put anything on it. Takes longer than my regular curl cream and hairspray routine",0 
"This product did not make my curls better it made them straight. Not happy.",0  
"Didn‚Äôt suit my skin even though I liked the smooth creamy texture",0 12."Very spotty coverage. Dry. Hard to get off your face! It's a horrible product and now I can't return because I've opened itüòí",0 
"This does not cover redness on my cheeks and dark circles under my eyes. It's a spongy texture. It goes on smooth and light weight. This foundation makes you look like you have no make up on. I bought the medium to deep, which is to light for my skin. My color skin is fair so the medium to deep should be a little darker than my skin and it is not. I love the way my under eyes look with this foundation. It does not look dry and wrinkly."-1 
"This stuff is the biggest rip off... No coverage, cheap whipped makeup if you can call it that. Whipped up like frosting you would place on a cupcake.. Difficult to apply and doesn't cover anything. Don't waste your hard earned money for $29.00 you can go to Target and get Loreal makeup at $12.99 for each bottle that's two for the price of one and it has coverage. Then you still have enough left over money go to McDonald's for a treat. I do not recommend this cupcake frosting...that has no coverage at all..",1 
"Worst product used ever! I bought all 3 shades. Nudes, porcelain, and classic for light and medium skin tone. I even blended them to get the usual shade I wear. It just doesn't blend with my skin, I kept caking up, it doesn't blur, it just cake up. The worst product ever made! Don't buy it!",1 ------UV LED Nail Lamp 
"I use the gel dnd polish and 30 seconds for 1 thin layer, makes the gel harden without any sticky residue! perfect and easy to use. don‚Äôt forget to properly prep your nails :) love this and saves me nail time!",0 
"I used this one time and pulled it out today because I was feeling some fall nails only to be super disappointed. I love sunuv and this was actually my second lamp from them (my other was great and lasted about 5 years) so I‚Äôm honestly shocked and heartbroken.",1 
"I‚Äôve had previous Sun UV Model dryers and this is the BEST one by far! Save money and DIY nails at home! Why pay nail salon nail prices when you can do it right in the comfort of your own home! I use it with Beetles gel nail polish, base & top coat, works excellent!",0 
"I am just getting into nails and had purchased another lamp that was not powerful enough for the dip powder gel method nails I was trying to do. This one is a great alternative because the cost is reasonable and it has the power! Good size, easy to use. Would def recommend.",0
"The dryer is great. Just as nice as the one that my manicurist has! It does a nice job! ",0 
"Bought to help save time. Instead of a single finger or trying to do 2 you can now do a hand at a time.",0 21."Not only do I LOVE my Sun UV nail lamp, I am super impressed with the company.",1
"I purchased my Sun UV nail lamp in June 2023. I bought it mainly for doing UV resin, which btw works AMAZINGLY for this purpose. I have NEVER had a problem with it not curing the resin.",1
"I did start to have intermittent problems recently with the lamp wanting to turn on so I reached out to the company via email through Amazon. They immediately got back to me, and let me know how to trouble shoot the issue. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt help, so they asked me to send them a video showing the problem. I did that. They immediately got back to me, letting me know they were sending out a replacement! What!? Who does that anymore! Luckily this all took place a few days before my one year purchase anniversary or I don‚Äôt know if they would have been able to help, but I didn‚Äôt have to find out.",1

"The rear camera is not particularly good, and while the speakers are adequately loud, they don't deliver high sound quality. However, the headphone jack provides decent audio.",1
"The only drawback that affects my experience is that the display has a cooler color temperature, with no option to adjust it except through the eye comfort feature. However, considering the price, this is within expectations.",1 
"Everything is okay. But display is too much worst like basic phone smart phone clarity...if Ur HD clarity viewer don't go for it...I am really disappointed..",1 
"Nice, but display quality could be better, battery discharges too early maybe due to TFT display. Other features are good. Good for studies and work with multi-tasking. Speakers are good enough, camera decent as a tablet. No complaints on UI it's the new version I recently upgraded to one UI 6.1 Android 14. Dex mode is great. That's all.",1

It looks even better than in the pictures and I‚Äôm very happy with it. A small downside is the shipping. It did take long, as it was being shipped from Ukraine to Spain. However, I was not in a hurry and it was worth the wait. Overall 100% recommended if you‚Äôre okay with waiting a few weeks before it‚Äôs delivered.",1 
"Great workmanship and flexible customization. Seller was patient with my queries too!",1

"Over all the box is beautiful. I love the color and the wood grains. Although I am very disappointed with the quality of the monogram on the glass lid. It seems very delicate and chips off very easily. Came delivered with a few chips in it already. Also it's just not very visible. I did choose to get engraving done on the box itself which turned out wonderful. The shipping took about a week longer than estimated and I was originally given the wrong tracking number so became a little concerned when I was notified my package was delivered to a different state.

He likes Nike, but Nike does not come in wide. I don't know why, but evidently, they refuse to make a wide shoe. Anyway, I took a chance on these Puma's because of the Wide Width. Plus they look decent and the price was pretty good. It says 9W on the Box and it says Wide Fit on the box, but they are NOT WIDE width. Just a regular shoe. Too tight for his feet. Had to return. Buyer Beware.",1

"This light is so awesome! There is so many different effects you can do using the GOVEE App which is available for iOS & Android/Google Devices. This is specifically made for corners and it does a great job at lighting up the space. I am extremely pleased with the comfort of my bedroom with my Govee lights which adds the perfect touch and sets the mood. The light does not get hot when you touch it. The light is like a rubbery material and the installation process was super easy and quick. You can set a timer to have the lights turn off when you need them to and the possibilities of all the features and colors is endless! I highly recommend Govee products, I am so happy!! This does not come with a remote control but you can use your phone to connect the light with the Govee app and your phone is used as the remote. It‚Äôs super convenient but Govee does have an actual remote sold separately that you can add numerous Govee Products to the remote. Overall, the Govee Corner Stick light is a great addition to any room and adds the perfect amount of brightness that you can turn up or down. Govee has made their light‚Äôs special. You get to choose the brightness, the color(s), the effects as far as if you want your lights to stay still, jump around, move with the sounds around them, and tons more. ",1 
"These are the cheaper model Tower LED's but they work with the movie sync and with other RGB products by govee that we have. I ordered two of them.

"I will get the only negative comment out of the way first in this review. The packing job was a bit too loose in my opinion, for an item with parts that can easily get damaged or scratched. A more secured packaging method could definitely be done with more care for the item considered. That being said, my chandelier arrived in one piece with no damage to any of its parts, thankfully. It comes with a detailed, easy to follow instruction guide for assembly and installation, and all the hardware necessary to get the job done. I do suggest that for buyers without any residential electrical experience, time, stress and possible injury can be avoided by hiring a professional electrician to do the installation for you. You can save money by doing the assembly part yourself beforehand. The finished look is really beautiful. It is sophisticated without being over the top, a lovely, elegant piece of lighting decor that will add a lot of class to any room.",1

I think they look great. They seem pretty sturdy. I definitely recommend them! I bought them in prime day so I got a really good deal. But they are worth the money I spent!",1 90."I had a piece of stainless steel metal from a refrigerator door. I was unsure of how to use it. Then it occurred to me that I could hang the metal piece on the wall and attach these units to it and arrange our spices and other items in our pantry. We had room and it fit well. I know this is unusual. The magnets are very strong and held everything we needed. In fact, I got two more units of these and put up another stainless steel sheet that fit well. Our pantry is very well organized now. We can change the shelves as needed with ease.",0 
"The four shelves are not the same size. When they ship, each larger shelf has a smaller shelf that fits inside it. The bigger shelves can fit two rows of most of your typical-sized round or square spice bottles, but the smaller shelves are just small enough that you can only fit one row of spices. Additionally, the "holds up to 8 lbs" is extremely generous. There is absolutely no way these could hold 8 lbs securely. The magnet was very unstable (see video) with 4.5lbs and was barely hanging on with a total of just under 6lbs.I will be returning these.",1 
"I just received this product. As others say, the magnets are quite strong and I'm not concerned that it won't hold. I looked at the product description dimensions listed and it was perfect. Then they arrived and there are 2 of the 4 that are that size, and the other 2 are smaller, and only one row of my spice jars will fit. So now I have to order another set to get what was advertised. The product is fine, but 1 star for false advertising."

"We ordered this on an Amazon Prime day special. I was really aggravated because it was obviously damaged. The buttons on the front were at an angle, and the oven didn't work at all. I swear, I think vendors take advantage of Prime day to off-load damaged items. If you order this, check it and try it out RIGHT AWAY. A new one was sent right away, I must say. Other than that, the air fryer is much easier to use than my Instapot's air fryer. It's a standard toaster oven configuration, with 3 rack settings. One of the settings is just to flip the rack, but not a big deal. I made eggplant Parmesan and breaded the eggplant. I spritzed the cutlets with olive oil, but it wasn't a uniform application, so it didn't brown evenly. My fault. I tried spraying them with a commercial cooking spray, and they browned perfectly! I did enough eggplant to make 2 pans, and the air fryer component worked great. I tried regular fries, and sweet potato fries, and they did a nice job on those, too. Pretty satisfied.",1 
"I love this air Fryer, so much better than a toaster oven for toast, air fry option is great, very easy to use and fits easy on a kitchen counter.",0 
"1. first thing i required was LIGHTED display, others are hard to operate in dim lighting. next, i require a KNOB to spin for settings, others require tedious punching buttons. THIS IS NOT AN AIR FRYER (calling it that is for marketing - cuz air fryers are all the rage, it seems), it is a convection oven (blowing air), much better than conventional/standard oven, This oven keeps temperature even throughout without hot spots. ability to control both the top and bottom heating elements - there are so many uses for this. can't wait to try dehydrating fruits and meats (Jerky). the pre-sets are surprisingly accurate - I put a regular sized cake pan in oven and set it to bake - came out perfect. same for frozen pizza. i suggest you buy a $9 toaster for bread and bagels etc. cuz toasting bread takes three times longer in this oven vs. countertop toaster. if you‚Äôre looking for a versatile appliance that can handle various cooking methods, a convection oven is a great choice (and this one can cook large items). However, if you want crispy results with less oil than deep frying (and limited to a couple portions), an air fryer is the way to go!",1

"The boy who received this was very much pleased with it.",1 
"My great nephew loves trains and is autistic. He was just fascinated when his mom turned it on for him in his room.",1 
"The tint is just enough with just a little sparkle. Goes on easy and feels light. Stays on under reasonable conditions. Feels moisturizing too.",0 
"I usually get cheap lipsticks/balms, but wanted to try something new. Very moisturizing and I love the pink color that shows up, I add regular lip balm over it to mute it down if it's to bright for the look I'm going for. Light sweet scent is lovely, no taste. Easily my new favorite lip balm! For sure going to keep on ordering! Pricey but worth it.",1 
"I loved the feeling and color of this gloss. It changes color according to your ph balance. The color is natural looking, the formula is smooth and soft on application. I would definitely buy this again.",0 
"Love this "Unicorn" lip balm by Winky Lux. It smells and tastes good, and turns my lips into the prettiest shade of pink. The balm stick itself is pretty - it's a translucent color with glitter. Everything about this is so pretty!",1 
"t has several flavors in the bag something for everyone. Very good quality nice and fresh and delicious. Good value for the money.",1 
"The heat index here has been 108*. I was so afraid to order chocolate but it said they would arrive in with a cooling pack. They arrived in perfect condition. I did throw them in the fridge for an hour just in case, but they were great and did not melt. They taste so fresh. Great price! I ate too many already!" ,1
"They look nice! They fit in my cabinets perfectly. They are good quality and can be used for many things. They work good and are easy to clean. I would recommend these if you like to bake they have many sizes.",0
"So many wonderful items for such a great price. Nice quality bowls/measuring utensils.",0
"These bowls and lids are great. I love the shredder and slicer and they clean up easily in the dishwasher. I recommend placing the lids on the top dishwasher rack to ensure the lids maintain their shape but even on the bottom they maintain their shape and seal if you place them on the bowls and leave them on for a while. The sizes allow you to measure, mix, and store right in the bowls. The silicone base is the best feature and provides a firm foundation as you mix vigorously. The extra measuring tools and silicone utensils are a nice bonus. Would buy again as a gift!",1
"Love the variety of sizes and the lids help for storing food in the fridge. I also love that non-skirt bottoms. 135.The bowls are sturdy and gorgeous! I appreciate the fact that they have lids and graters. Also, my fiance does alot ok baking and he indicted that he had no issues in terms of the bowls sliding on the counter while mixing! Great buy! 
"I love this bowl set because the rubber bottoms make it easy to stir and mix. And the fact that they come with lids means I can use them for marinades. They make it easy to transport, as well. They also stack nicely, which is a space saver.",1
"This is my 2nd item out of all the 1000s of purchases that Im so impressed with. Many things are junky and you learn to live with but this just wow, from China on Amazon, once in the lifetime. Best 35bucks. Lids are not flimsy at all, every sizing spoon, I never even knew they made white and egg yoke separator tool, but now I have one, all important size bowls for cooking/baking, with nice silicone bottoms. I could brag about this item forever, not to mention it was delivered overnight. 2nd item FYI is Opolar 20000mah (for 40bucks), the best battery portable fan, we had that thing forever and still works like a champ. All the other 998 items I could trash but these 2 are treasures.",1
"My box was received taped over the little tab that locks into the lid. When I cut open the tape on the box I noticed there was only one large red lid that didn‚Äôt fit on any of the bowls. The largest bowl I received was the purple bottomed bowl. The bowls appear to be well made and the rubber bottom does seem to be a nice addition. The weight is good and the bowls seem solid. I can‚Äôt say much about the lid because I only received one that didn‚Äôt fit on anything and did not have a recessed area for the round graters. So the circular graters are useless. The functionality of the bowls are greatly reduced due to the lack of lids (no storage option) and I just feel deceived by the pictures that display a full set.",1 
"These lids are in no way air tight, at all. They will eventually pop up and off. Such a cool idea and a huge disappointment in reality.",0
"This could have been a fun purchase except the set I received is mismatched. Largest bowl has beige bottom instead of black like the rest of the set. For >$40 on sale, this is a disappointment. Will be returning.",1 
"I have been handwashing these lids and they still curve and morph. Had them a week or two and they no longer close tightly in the containers anymore. I do not recommend this item.",1 
"These bowls are scratching from normal use and i can't get company to reply horrible product",1
"I got this set for my daughter and just found out she never received the lids. She has been using the graters by hand. Can I buy a set of lids for her.",1
"This is a great skillet. You need to know that it is quite heavy. It is pre-seasoned and needs special care, nothing hard, very easy (you can find instructions on the internet). I am preparing eggs, steaks, vegetables, chicken, and many more foods on it. If you need a good, reliable cast iron skillet, this is the one to choose.",1. 
"The workmanship is beautiful. The extra handle is handy to use. The preconditioned pan needs to have water boiled in it for sterilization, before cooking food. Dispose of the hot water and wipe the pan dry. Set the pan back on heat removing all moisture from it's pores. While the pan is still semi-hot, put in very little oil, 5 drops and distribute with a paper towel. Coconut oil is best. For storage put in a paper towel and lid it. The pan is good for many generations. The only way this pan can be damaged is to throw a very hot pan in the snow.",1
"Cast iron is the way to go, and this is a great start! It is a MASSIVE skillet. I've cooked various foods on this, and they always come out perfect. Stuff like meat cooks the best, as it can get super hot, and as long as you use a heat-stable oil like animal fats, it will always come out tasting perfect and better than using a traditional nonstick skillet. This is an awesome skillet, and I will be buying from the company again in the near future!",1
"I was surprised how fast it heated up on our glass top stove. I fry an egg and some ham most mornings, the lid fits tightly so I can steam the egg. Afterwards when the pan cools I wash it with a little soap and hot water. Nothing is sticking to it. I do spray the pan with Crisco olive oil before putting the egg in the pan. It doesn't harm the glass top of the stove, but because it's relatively heavy I am careful how I set it on the stove and I don't move it around". 
"Sorry for the long review - for the short review, count the stars! I'm a bit of a purist.I always season my cast iron - new, or used (hey, I don't know WHAT someone else used that old piece of cast iron for - maybe cleaning auto parts). I sand it down to bare metal, starting with about an 80 grit and finishing with 200.Then I season. The end result is a glossy black mirror that puts Teflon to shame. There are two mistakes people make when seasoning - not hot enough, not long enough. These mistakes give the same result - a sticky brown coating that is definitely not non-stick, and the first time they bring any real heat to the pan, clouds of smoke that they neither expected or wanted. I see several complaints here that are completely due to not knowing this. But there were a few pieces I needed (yes, needed, cast iron isn't about want, it's a need), and this was one of them, so I thought I'd give the Lodge pre-seasoning a try. Ordered last Friday, received this Friday - free shipping, yay! The first thing I noticed was the bumpy coating. The inside is actually rougher than the outside, and my hand was itching for the sandpaper, but that would have defeated the experiment. This time, I was going to give the Lodge pre-seasoning a chance before I broke out the sandpaper. So I scrubbed the pan out with a plastic brush and a little soapy water, rinsed well, put it on a medium burner, and waited. Cast iron tip number one - give it a little time. Then give it a little more time. Cast iron conducts heat much more slowly than aluminum, so you have to have a little patience. Then I threw in a pat of butter, and brought out the natural enemy of badly seasoned cast iron - the egg. And, sure enough, it stuck - but not badly, just in the middle. A bit of spatula work and I actually got a passable over-medium egg. Hmmm. But still not good enough. So I cleaned up the pan, and broke out the lard. I have only one justification for using lard. I don't remember Grandma using refined hand-pressed organic flax oil, or purified extra-virgin olive oil made by real virgins. Nope, it was pretty much animal fat in her iron. A scoop of bacon grease from the mason jar beside the stove and she was ready to cook anything. Grandaddy wouldn't eat a piece of meat that had less than a half-inch of fat around it. "Tastes like a dry old shoe.", he'd declare if it was too lean. In the end, I'm sure their diet killed them, but they ate well in the meantime. Grandaddy was cut down at the tender age of 96, and Grandma lasted till 98. Eat what you want folks - in the end, it's pretty much up to your genetics. So I warmed up my new pieces, and smeared a very thin layer of lard all over them - use your fingers. Towels, especially paper towels, will shed lint, and lint in your seasoning coat doesn't help things at all. Besides, it's kinda fun.Here's cast iron tip number two - season at the highest temp you think you'll ever cook at - or higher. If you don't, you won't get the full non-stick thing, and the first time you bring it up to that temp you'll get clouds of smoke from the unfinished seasoning. I put my pieces in a cold oven, and set the temp for an hour at 500 degrees (F, not C). Yeah, I know, Lodge says 350. Lodge doesn't want panicked support calls from people whose house is full of smoke. Crank the heat up. You have two choices here. You can put a fan in the kitchen window and blow smoke out of your house like the battleship Bismarck under attack by the Royal Navy, or invest in an oxygen mask. You will get smoke. You will get lots of smoke, especially if you're doing several pieces at once, like I just did. This is a good thing - that's smoke that won't be jumping out to surprise you the first time you try to cook with any real heat. The goal is to heat until you don't get smoke, and in my experience, 500 degrees for an hour does that pretty well. Let the pieces cool in the closed oven. Then re-grease and repeat. And repeat again. And don't glop the fat on. Just enough to coat. More thin layers are better than fewer gloppy layers. I managed four layers last night without my neighbors calling the fire department. Seems like a lot of work? Look at it this way. It's a lifetime commitment. Treat your iron well, and it will love you right back like you've never been loved before. And this is pretty much a one-time deal, unless you do something silly. The end result of my all-night smoking up the kitchen exercise? Dry, absolutely no stickiness, black as a coal mine at midnight and shiny - but still bumpy - could it possibly work with that rough surface? I put the skillet back on a medium burner, put a pat of butter on and tossed in a couple of eggs. After the whites had set a little, I nudged them with a spatula, and they scooted across the pan. I'll be... it works. My wife came back from the store and wanted scrambled eggs. If there's anything that cast iron likes less than fried eggs, it's scrambled. But it was the same thing all over again. No stick. No cleanup. Just a quick hot water rinse with a brush in case something got left on the pan (I couldn't see anything, but hey), then I put it on a med-hi burner till dry, put a thin coat of lard on the pan and waited until I saw smoke for a minute. Let cool and hang up. Done. So. do I like the bumpy texture of the Lodge pre-season? Nope. Does it work? Yes, and contrary to my misgivings, it works very well. My wife pointed out that even some Teflon cookware has textured patterns in it. The Lodge pre-season isn't a perfect surface out of the box - but it does give you a big head-start. After a night's work, my iron is ready to face anything, and you just can't beat that. Lodge makes a great product. For the quality, durability, and versatility, you can't beat Lodge cast iron. Plus, it's made in America. I like that. If you've never experienced cast iron cooking, you've just been cheating yourself. Plus, the price, for a piece of lifetime cookware, is insanely cheap".,1
"I have ordered this pan not once, not twice, but 3 times on Amazon, as I wanted to gift one for Christmas. These were made by Lodge, I've owned Lodge, Lodge makes a nice pan. "Lodge is a safe choice", "Lodge is a good choice". That just doesn't seem to be true anymore".,1
"You can see from the pictures the "quality" that Lodge is currently putting out. Worse still, after showing these same pans to Lodge customer service wanting to know why the quality was so bad, they decided to argue with me. I was told that no, the pans are supposed to look like that. The the rust spots on all 3 pans from uneven seasoning by the factory that shouldn't have passed inspection were "normal". That the file lines on the sides of the pan that look horrific, are "normal". That this was my fault for finding this unacceptable. Rather than actually do anything besides ensuring that the point was hammered home about how this is "acceptable quality" for a Lodge product (or THREE), they have decided to ignore me entirely. Hopefully these awful pans once they arrive back At Amazon don't go to some other poor soul to deal with".,1
"As this is Lodge's new "normal" quality standard, do yourself a favor, and find a new "normal safe brand" to be your new go to. I would never purchase, nor would recommend a Lodge pan after this. If asked, I will have no shame in saying absolutely not, never purchase from them. At this point with how mad I am over this whole thing, my family and friends are indeed well aware of the poor quality, and upon seeing what I received themselves, will no longer be looking at Lodge for new cast iron in the future.,0
"I'll be purchasing from a different "Proudly Made in America" brand, because Lodge should be ashamed.",1 
"I've purchased the 8-inch skill from Amazon 3 times, and every time it comes with the same defect in the same spot in the coating of the pan. Seems like a manufacturing defect. It's probably fixable and maybe won't impact the actual cooking functionality of the pan, but not worth it. I buy a brand new cast iron skillet from what I thought was a reputable brand like Lodge from a reputable seller like Amazon (not even 3P seller) so that I shouldn't have to worry about these defects. I've given up on getting this product.",0 
"It arrived on time. I cooked my burgers on it the same night. After dinner, I washed it carefully with a soft sponge (like I would wash nonstick skillets). The next day when I wanted to use it again, it was covered with rust. It is not real cast iron. It is just regular iron.",0 
"Skillet product is great - wanted to have it - but skillet wall was cracked near the handle. Can look at it two ways: Handling was "too rough" during transit, or packaging was inadequate for the job. Either way, doesn't matter, can't use the skillet, had to return.",1
"I was in the market for looking for meal prep containers since I keep cooking for myself and my grandma. Came upon these and used one the other night in the microwave. It was very good quality for a container. Good size too to use and easy to clean as well. I like how the seal works for the lids as well too.",0
"Highly recommend for anyone looking for meal prep containers to use.",0
"I've put this set of ten through one freeze and microwave reheat cycle. They've held up, including the lids. The problem is the lids don't feel very secure, and the containers are flimsy, which makes them a bit of a pain to hand wash. Maybe they'll last a good long time, but they don't seem like they will. I'll use these for a bit before upgrading to glass.",0
"Better than most meal prep containers! Love how each section is measured out! Get them to make your meal prep life easier!",0
"I bought these, the box was damaged upon arrival, and some of the lids had been damaged, These ARE NOT LEAK PROOF!!! I carried it sideways in my backpack to work and it leaked juice from one compartment into another and then onto the items in my backpack, It was a real bummer, I do like, however, that the measurements are listed on the bottom of the spots where you put the food so you know how much you're putting in that area, They are easy to clean as well, I wash mine by hand since I don't have a dishwasher, They are functional, as long as they stay upright.", 1
"These are awesome, This makes meal prep for mom so much easier.",0
"Very good purchase and very good quality.",0
"Fits easily in everyone's bag- goes back and forth daily for lunch and for meals enroute to after-school activities, I have a few of these and I love the colours, I bought different sizes in different colours and they wash easily and stack easily- taking up very little space in the cupboard, Love these!!", 1
"I can use this with ANY of my pots, Anything that needs to be drained, I grab this item, Quick and easy to attach, Dishwasher safe, They will make excellent stocking stuffers even for noncooks.", 1
"It works very well, I have not had it release and dump contents into the sink, It will replace your hand-held pot strainers and it is tall enough that what you are draining doesn't come over the front of it, Good item to have.", 1
"Clips to pan nicely, Easy to clean, Durable plastic, Makes pouring out liquid easy, Great product.", 1
"LOVE this!! Takes no effort & totally replaces a traditional colander!!! Fits on every pan I have used, very secure, takes the heat of boiling water, and is completely non-slip, Easy to clip to pots, may need a little pushing with pots that have a 'lip' but once it's on - it's not moving until you take it off, My only complaint is that it could be bigger in the height - I am always careful not to tip the pan too much as I wouldn't want my macaroni to fall over it into the sink, A backup colander in the sink takes away that potential issue, But it is a great product & frees up both hands for draining, Washes & dries nice.", 1
"The strainer worked better than expected, Its compact design makes it easier to store than bulky strainers, The purple color stands out nicely in crowded cupboards or drawers.", 1
"Only used it once to date for making spaghetti, It clipped onto the pot and it held in place which, honestly, surprised me when I drained the water out, I was half expecting it to fall off, Easy to clean as well.", 1
"I had my doubts about how well this would work, but it is fabulous, Easy to snap on, drains perfectly, and is easy to store, Sure beats a huge colander, Highly recommend!", 1
"I couldn‚Äôt get it to attach or work well, I should have returned but missed the window of opportunity, When dealing with boiling water this is not a reliable solution.", 1
"This was so hard to put on our pots that it just didn't work, We had to return it, We can not recommend.",0
"Epic fail of a product, The clamps don't open to clamp on to pots properly and leaves a gap defeating the purpose.", 1
"The strainer is a great idea but the one I received has a moldy odor, like it was stored in a damp, moldy basement, The box that it came in was dry but had a bad smell that filled my office when I opened the Amazon box, At first I thought that the smell would go away if I threw the box out, I washed and dried the strainer 3 times, The smell remains, someone told me to soak it in vinegar and salted water, so I marinated it for 6 hours, Then I washed it with Dawn and water, dried it, At first I thought that the smell was gone but after I placed it in my cabinet with pots and pans the next morning everything in my cabinet was smelling moldy like the strainer, I threw it away because I had thrown away the packaging, I don't recommend shopping from this distributor because they have a storage problem.", 0
"Does not clip onto any pot that I own, If your pans or pots have any type of lip this will not work whatsoever, Piece of crap.", 0

"Good monitor for brightness, which was my top concern, But shortly after one year of owning it, it stopped receiving a signal from my M1 MacBook Pro, Tried it on multiple devices, and used various cables, Nothing worked, Uperfect customer support replied fairly quickly, but said the device had reached the end of its life and since it was out of warranty there was nothing they could do, A product like this shouldn't die so quickly, and it bugs me that I'm throwing electronics away and into a landfill, Not okay, Look elsewhere.", 1

"These divider folders expand well and hold what I need them to within my binder, I am concerned that they're on the thinner side, The holes are not reinforced, If the product were updated, that's what should be improved.", 1
"These have helped my grandson to maintain an organized study tool for school, They have a pocket as well as divider tabs for easy access to organized paperwork, Bright colors is the cherry on top!", 1
"Very colorful",0
"Brought this for someone else to help them organize their mail, Worked really well for it as papers can be placed in the pockets and you can label the dividers, More than enough came in the pack and the price and quality are good.", 1
"It does just what it says",0
"Yeah, don‚Äôt buy these, Brand new out of the box, unexpanded, the tab labels on the side are unreadably tucked way underneath the edge, The pocket is creased in the wrong place, too much overhang, Tried putting on adhesive tags, didn‚Äôt make them readable, There isn‚Äôt any way to do it to get around the design, Not a win for middle schoolers, And they really should have a pocket on the backside, if we‚Äôre asking for perfect here.", 0
"I am extremely disappointed with this item, Some of the tabs on the folders are defective i.e. mismatched size, unable to see the writing on tab when labeled etc, Paper doesn't fit smoothly in the pockets, Also very thin, I would have returned them if I hadn't written on the tabs, Very mismatched and many defective, Need 0 stars.", 0

Glad I kept the packaging in tact, definitely buying something in person next time, I think the quality of the plastic could hold paper but not for long and not too much, it would tear but my main problem is the holes not lining up and the fact that the folder itself covers the label entirely and is cut in a way with the folders that the tabs are down towards the bottom that it‚Äôs impossible to fold it out of the way so what‚Äôs the point of the tabs if they are just permanently covered, Poorly put together.", 0
"The quality is questionable", 0
"Tabs are scrunched, pockets are not folded right.", 0
"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but I have to regarding this product. It is cheaply made. Binder holes are super small, you would have to use a hole puncher to make bigger ones. The expandable pocket is big but that means it over hangs and covers some of the tabs when it‚Äôs not holding items. Overall I would like to return it but there was no option to do that. I do not recommend.", 0
"I got the burnt orange/ terracotta one, it‚Äôs perfect! So soft and light weight but warm and comfy!", 1
"The package was deceptively small, as it was vacuum sealed (tightly). After a couple of days the blanket fluffed up into a soft, lightweight blanket. It‚Äôs well structured, but not too hot or heavy perfect for summer/spring months. After a couple washes I‚Äôve noticed no changes in color or shape. It‚Äôs the perfect cuddle buddy ü•∞", 1
"Not the greatest quality but it's just what we needed for the time being. Hopefully, it will last for a good amount of time. I love the color!! It's kind of soft. Fits our California King bed perfectly. I am worried about stains. God forbid my four year old accidentally spills something on the cover.", 1
"Looks super cute! Cozy. I doubled it up on top of a white down comforter and it looks very chic good value for money. Quality was good I was unsure because the pics look wrinkly. My burnt orange does not have a wrinkle issue lol", 1
"I was hesitant due to some of the other reviews; however, it is the nicest material- it's so soft and fluffy. I have a double bed for reference and I got the king size as I like extra blanket to hand over the edge. Great product for the price. Highly recommend", 1
"I loved it! I like that it has an intermediate weight and that makes it very comfortable for this time when it's already hot. I bought it in winter and it also felt really warm. The fabric is soft and easy to wash. I love the color. I would definitely buy another one.", 1
"I loved the color, it's light and soft. Very comfortable and fits perfectly with my double bed", 1
"I was really excited to purchase this as the reviews rave about how its not too hot and very comfortable to use in the summer. I did not put it on my bed till about 2 weeks ago. This weekend I decided to wash it as it need to be washed and it literally came out of the dryer in a ball.. all of the stuffing is not all together and the threading from the inside is all tangled together. I decided to pull it apart only to find out it ripped the threading on the inside with the dividers. Really nice until you decide it needs a wash, my washer and dryers are huge and it totally had the space to not be in one spot. Really sad my return window is closed.", 0
"I like the color and look of the comforter. I can in a small tight vacuum packed package. So the comforter is and will be wrinkled. As you can tell from the picture. I did try to steam it. But still has quite a few wrinkles in it. The color is as described. However, the comforter itself is not. It is very thin and not very 'full'. Not much stuffing to the comforter. I am afraid once it is washed it may rip or color will fade. Very cheap like material. It was on sale and had a coupon to attach. Which made it $30. I am very disappointed in the quality and texture of this material. For the time being I will just keep. But definitely need a replacement one. This is not a product I would recommend. Be aware you will be disappointed if you purchase this comforter.", 0
"I‚Äôve had toilet paper thicker and better quality than this comforter. The fabric is cheap, wrinkled, and rough. Disregard all reviews that say otherwise. I wish I had just purchased a quality comforter instead of wasting my money on this product. You truly get what you pay for with this one. Don‚Äôt kid yourself into thinking you‚Äôre getting a good deal here. I‚Äôm generously giving it one star as the color is pretty but that is the only nice thing I can truthfully say. In all other regards it is just another piece of garbage to go into a landfill. I‚Äôm disappointed.", 0
"The comforter arrived vacuum sealed, and is covered in wrinkles. I washed and dried it, which didn‚Äôt do much to remove them, so I spent 3 hours using a steamer to get the majority of them out. The material will start pilling if the heat from the steamer is applied too long to one area, so I had to keep moving it around, then go back over areas for a second and third time once they were cool. The company should really consider NOT shipping these vacuum sealed, as it would make it much more convenient for consumers.", 0
"I think it‚Äôs a good value for the price. They smell nice too & the add ons are appreciated. They are soft & not sticky or messy.", 1
"For the price it‚Äôs honestly amazing quality. Each container is filled fully and awesome. They don‚Äôt smell the best, but spraying some perfume or adding lotion will fix the smell! Great value, good quality and honestly amazing butter slime.", 1
"Lemon doesn't smell like lemon but, these little bitty slices are great and come with great confetti and add ins. All but the lemon smell great, even the chocolate one! I'll buy more in the future. Perfect to keep in a purse for kids. Or yourself!", 1
"My daughter loves her slime and it smells good and doesn't stick to my furniture.", 1
"The kids loved them",0
"I‚Äôm not a big fan of slime but this product is very good. It‚Äôs not sticky so it doesn‚Äôt get everywhere nor does it make a mess when my kids play with it.", 1
"This slime feels amazing and smells great! Other slimes smell so bad but these smell good. However, it dries out very quickly with not that much exposure to air. Also the one that I did not use as much grew mold after a few days of not being used.", 1
"It wasn't as soft as I thought it would be and the smell was strong not in a good way. Smells too industrial.", 0
"I ordered this exact set about a year ago and I loved them. They lasted long and the texture was great. However... I repurchased these and it was missing the yellow slime and they dried out within two days. I don't know if they changed their recipe or what but these are not good.", 0
"This product ruined my wall and children‚Äôs clothing. It‚Äôs extremely sticky and does not come off what it comes in contact with. Do not recommend.", 0
"Was delivered yesterday, 6 year old played with it for a couple hours and we put it away tightly in the containers. By this morning, it's done. Dried out. Lotion, conditioner, etc. nothing works. If it would have lasted a few days, I'd give 5 stars, but not even 24 hours? Nope. Never buy these!", 0
"Save your $ - not worth it - SO small. I was shocked", 0
"Absolutely gorgeous silver sandals, they aren‚Äôt very comfortable but a thin soled 4 inch stiletto heeled shoe isn‚Äôt going to be. They seem to be made really well and definitely fit true to size", 1
"Suuperrrrr cute I love it ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ classy black heels",0
"Fit nicely",0
"These heels are very nice and easy to combine, the size matches but they are a little tight, the ankle strap is narrow and I struggle a little to get inside the foot, if you have wide feet I don't recommend them, they are a little uncomfortable since they don't have a platform (All heels without a platform are) and they have nothing to cushion the bottom of your feet. My foot measures 10.6" and a size 11 fits me perfectly", 1
"Classy",0
"Cuter in person honestly",0
"They are beautiful, great quality, right size and very comfortable.",0
"Beautiful! They are true to size, the heel is perfect. My baby wore these for prom she loved them. The strap where the pinky toe rests will start to hurt after a few hours (use a corn pad).", 1
"Slip safe and puncture safe, the water level can be adjusted, my dog LOVES it. Got one for a friend, I like it so much! Must have for dogs in summer!", 1
"Unfortunately, my dogs would not enter the pool unless the sprinkling stopped. However, it holds an inch or two of water, creating a pleasant spot for them to lie in after the hose is turned off. It is easy to hang over something to drain and dry completely, allowing it to be folded back up and stored.", 1
"My kids love it! My dogs are scared of it and ran off even though they like to swim in ponds. I‚Äôm hoping they warm up to using it because I bought this more for the dogs than the kids.", 1
"Liked it for kids too", 1
"Perfect product for people with dogs or small kids that don‚Äôt want to risk a pool just yet but want something to cool off! Its perfect and well made!! Very sturdy!", 0
"Dogs give their unconditional love and so much more! Sometimes wish I were a dog, then I think about it more and realize I'll stay human but love like a dog instead! This works best for large breed dogs and small children. I wish I had gotten a bigger one though. I like that the bottom of the pad is textured preventing slips and falls and be sure to trim your dogs nails too. I really like that you can adjust the height of the water stream and that the plug to the water tube is on the side not the top. I'm not going to lie but I also discovered this is an easy way to water potted plants, just put the plants down on the pad then turn on the water. Another fun way to keep your pets and children cool (and water your plants too!) Very giftable and unique to give!", 1
"This splash pad is super easy to set up connecting to a hose, very lightweight to carry, the water flow is consistent but not too heavy for smaller kids, it's a good quality way of entertainment and fun for multiple kids and even animals. Super affordable, occupies your kids for hours while keeping them cooled off in the summer heat, and very safe for even a baby to play in. These are awesome to have and make great gifts tooüí¶üéÅüòõ", 1
"I ordered this for my kids to play in in the Florida heat and they seem to enjoy it. It was fairly easy to put together but I did have a little difficulty removing the hose from it at the end of playtime. It definitely something fun to do with the kids when it's hot outside.", 1
"Assembly was easy enough, instructions are clear however you really don't need them. The pads are a nice touch to keep it from tearing up the door and once one stays pretty stable. Only gripe I have is the ball is just a bit too big for the hoop... It fits in it! But shots need to be spot on to go in any backboard or rim hit is gonna bounce out. But as an office toy I can't really complain I've always had a door hoop in my office my last one was damaged in the move and that one was pretty cheap in comparison. I like the size of this as the hoop is low compared to most allowing for better shooting so the ball doesn't hit the ceiling. Highly recommend", 1
"Got this for my kids they have been loving it. It‚Äôs sturdy, looks durable. Comes with 3 balls, very easy to inflate, and the basket and everything was easy to put together.", 1
"I bought this for my son who is 12 years old and he absolutely loves it! We decided to hang it over the door. It is very durable and good quality. It lights up when you make baskets and cheers you on. It is dunk proof, comes with 3 inflatable balls and a small hand pump to inflate the basketballs. The backboard is acrylic and the rim is metal with a nice net. Hours of entertainment.", 1
"Excellent for a dorm. Has a light-up backboard, the hoop will fold away against the door and actually keeps score. Good quality but I'm not sure anything can withstand dunks from football players. Excellent for Freshmen leaving for college.", 1
"Great indoor fun. The balls aren't too hard. The hoop is a good size for entertainment indoors. Fits the door well.", 1
"This Electronic Basketball Hoop is a well-designed and fun option for anyone looking to enjoy basketball indoors. Its sturdy construction, LED lights, and electronic scoreboard make it an engaging and interactive game for kids and adults. The easy installation and included accessories add to its convenience and value. The product comes with clear instructions, making it easy to assemble. Basic tools are needed, and the process is quick and hassle-free. It's designed to hang over standard doors, making it easy to set up and take down as needed. Good value.", 1
"So this was quick and easy to put together. The instructions were inside and they were very clear-cut. It only took a few minutes to put it together and blow up the balls for it. It's very lightweight and portable. You can hang it on the door and even screw it in if you wanted. Very durable and sturdy as well. You will need three AAA batteries to make the scoreboard work. Overall, it's a nice indoor basketball set.", 1
"Excellent for a dorm. Has a light-up backboard, the hoop will fold away against the door and actually keeps score. Good quality but I'm not sure anything can withstand dunks from football players. Excellent for Freshmen leaving for college.", 1
"I love this bracelet, it is very pretty and looks authentic.", 1
"Looks exactly like the pictures. I ordered Aquamarine for my daughter's birthstone in March and I love it. The clasp was loose but I fixed it with no issue at all. Very shiny and you definitely get what you pay for. Does not look cheap, in fact, they look like real diamonds and gems. I would recommend it as a gift for anyone who loves these styles.", 1
"It‚Äôs great quality and it fits and looks good with my other bracelets I wear every day. The color also is really the same as the picture and the clasp works great and still doesn‚Äôt dull down! I want reviews like these from Amazon.", 1
"I‚Äôve been looking at this set at the local fabric store. Wanted it but GEEZ so expensive. Paid half the price on here. Such a great set.",1
 "I was surprised but happy to see the cutting mat is like a puzzle piece. Easy to travel with but locks together smoothly for use.",1
"I bought this rotary cutting set because it looked to be a good deal. I have wanted a rotary cutter for a while now, but using the rotary cutter on you sewing table without any protection can seriously damage you table. So this set gave me, not only the rotary cutter, but also the board and a see through ruler that is very helpful for cutting straight lines. The rotary cutter is super sharp. So be careful when using it. You can also buy other extra cutters that you can use to replace the one that is on it now. I'm thinking of buying a wave blade. This give you a wavy edge that helps if your textile frays a lot, or so they say. For the record I am not a quilter, I sew apparel. This product is marketed as being for quilters, but I can tell you that as a hobby seamstress a rotary cutter comes in handy. You don't have to use scissors for straight cutting, also because of its shape you can use it for curved pieces. The cutting board is a little larger than I thought. But because of its larger size you can cut larger pieces. So it has its benefits.
All in all, I'm happy with my purchase. The price was good for such a set and I know it will make my sewing go a lot faster and easier now.
I am new at sewing so I purchased this set, including the rotary cutter. The mat & ruler are great, the rotary cutter not so much. I tried cutting with it through 4 layers of cotton material..no problem. The next couple of times it would not cut straight at all, even along the ruler. I thought it was my inexperience, until it suddenly fell apart. This resulted in the cutting bladed rolling around my bare floor. That God it didn‚Äôt fall on my bare foot! I contacted Fiskars but they will only replace it, not return my money. I explained more that once that I don‚Äôt need a new one as I had to run out that day & buy a new one in another brand. The only way to get my money back is to return the entire set to either Amazon or Fiskars but I don‚Äôt want to send a back the other items that I have already used & I need them now for another project. Buyer beware on buying a sent that includes a rotary cutter!!!! UPDATE: After talking to 3 different people at Fiskars, they finally agreed to return my money for the cutter only if I returned it, which I did today. I still do not recommend their rotary cutters. What a hassle.",1
"Only the board came",0
"The blade has dull areas. When I make a long cut on fabric, there are several uncut spots. I then have to locate each uncut spot, and then snip each one manually with scissors. It is a waste of time. This product did not simplify or speed up my cutting. I am sending for a replacement in hopes that I will get a functional rotary blade this time.",1
"Sturdy and glides smooth when pulling it. Love the color.",1
"First, the color and pattern combination is elegant and second, the materiel is sturdy and flexible to endure the rugged landscape of being thrown onto luggage trailers and conveyor belts!",1
"I used the luggage on our trip and it was extremely sturdy. Wheeling around the airport was a breeze. I wish the carryon had the expanding feature but all in all I am very happy with my purchase.",1
"Really nice looking and solidly built. Already tested with a trip overseas and held up well. Very good supplier.",0
"They are beautiful! Needed a new set with 4 wheels",0
"Rolls so nice no more tipping over ! Can‚Äôt wait to take them on vacation!",0
"by far the best luggage I've ever used. Very durable even going through 8 different airports. It surpassed its expectations",1
"I love this set. They nested well and are easy to store. They help up very well on their maiden voyage. I wipes them",0
"Down with a wet wipe and they are ready to travel again. Great price point.",1
"Easy to push/pull around, great quality.",0
"The color looks so expensive, love it",0
"I bought this set and took it for its maiden voyage with one connecting flight. The largest suitcases zipper was broken when I collected my luggage. The suitcase was not over packed, there wasn‚Äôt even a reason to expand the width, and was even under the weight requirement. I missed the return date by 4 days. I‚Äôm so very disappointed. For the price, I would have expected much better quality.",
"Product is not durable or resistant to anything. One round trip to Cancun and it's worthless. Buyer Beware!!",1
"I ordered the set and the smallest one came scratched, so I returned the set and got a refund and I bought a new set. The second set came and the smaller suitcase was scratched up again. I just can't be bothered to send it back again. Very disappointing.",1
"I received the 20 inch suitcase to review. Upon receiving it I was surprised at how lightweight it felt. Attractive hard plastic outer shell with a beautiful blue shade and brown trim. The wheels move fluidly and rolls across wonderfully, which makes transport easy. Has plenty of room with a couple of zipper zipper compartments. I didn't give as many stars as I'd like because I don't feel the outer shell will be able to withstand significant impact. I know it will be able to go through the rigors of airline travel and a fall down a flight of stairs but as far as the possibility of something more substantial, like a cart ramming into it or something like that, it will eventually crack. More suited for light travel.",
"This hard shell suitcase is very well put together. The case seems very lightweight and thin, but durable at the same time. The edging looks like some kind of synthetic material that is reinforced with stitching and glue. In the interior of the case, it has multiple zipper pockets, it is well lined and comes with securing straps that buckle. None of the material is super high quality, but for the price it's good enough for a decent weekender bag. I love the double lock where you use the zippers to lock the case and it has the TSA unlock right on it. It also has 360¬∞ wheels that turn, that are extremely quiet. It would be a good bag for a or a nice time traveler.",1
"This is a very basic Hard Side Carry-on Suitcase by Showkoo. It‚Äôs a very lightweight hard-shell suitcase which I would be worried about checking and handing over to airline baggage handlers. This carry-on might be ok if it‚Äôs only handled by the traveler but the larger sizes of this suitcase I would be wary of using. The inside opens to 2 compartments ‚Äì one side has a zipper closure with zippered pockets and the 2nd side has straps to hold clothing in. This carry-on has TSA locks, 360¬∞ spinner wheels and a telescoping handle. There are no instructions on setting a personal code for the locks. It‚Äôs an ok suitcase but doesn‚Äôt feel very durable in the long term.",1
This luggage wouldn't have held up on an overnight camping trip. I didn't even bother to take it out of its packaging after I felt the cheap material of the suitcase.. Don't waste your money on this one. If you buy cheap, you'll be buying cheap again, really soon. My advice, spend your money on a more quality suitcase maybe not more expensive per se but definitely more higher quality!!! This one isn't of the.quality!!!",1
"Flimsy. This hard cover luggage is flimsy feeling. My current non hard shell suitcase feels much studier than these. Packed up and sent it right back. I would not trust these to last long",1
"The 28 inch suitcase seems a bit flimsy would it stand up to a lot of battering asking anybody who's had these",1
"Value for money, great quality, great size for kids and adults. The cushion gives good lumbar support, and it‚Äôs well cushion so your legs won‚Äôt go numb.",0
"Not the most expensive chair; however, after three months of using this as my full time office chair, I am very satisfied. Don't expect this to be a Secretlab chair. The AutoFull chair is a great chair for the price. My use is as a full time office chair during the day (lots of screen time and zoom meetings) and an internet browsing and minor gaming chair in the evening.",0
"The strength of this chair is the back and seat comfort. Once one finds the sweet spot for the pillows, the chair is quite comfortable. Be aware that this is not a "cushy" office chair. The seat feels like a very firm memory foam and the sides of the seat bottom raise to an angle that does give one that "bucket seat" feel. The pillow for the back also has a memory foam feel; however, there is more give and it adjusts well once the "sweet spot" for placement is found. The neck pillow is comfortable; however, I have to keep reaching up to adjust it to the correct position. It attaches to the chair back, it is just that I need to move it up from the natural location where it attaches. For me, a major strength of this chair is the setting that allows a little give when leaning back. This allows a bit of a rocking function and that is a very big advantage for me",1
"The chair back is very solid and does go above my head. This is one of the reasons I went with a gaming chair versus an office chair. The recline for the chair sets the back at almost 90 degrees to just less than 180 degrees. If reclined, there is a footrest that can be deployed. This is one reason I picked this chair and in reality, I don't use it much. The only time the footrest is comfortable is when the chair almost fully reclined.",1
"The arms of the chair are nicely adjustable. A choice has to be made during assembly to determine how wide to place the arms. After using the chair for a couple days, I took off the arms and moved them to a closer setting the the side of the seat. The vertical adjustment is smooth and easy. It is also possible to adjust the angle of the armrests to twist them to one of three settings, pointing away from the seat, pointing parallel to the seat, and pointing toward the seat. The one thing I would like is to have the ability for the armrests to move forward and backward.",1
"The assembly was straight forward. By chance, I helped put together a Secretlab Titan Evo chair two days before I assembled this chair. The parts were not as well organized in this chair as with the Secretlab chair, but the instructions for the AutoFull chair were easy to follow and all parts were in the package.",0
"In conclusion, this chair is not as nice as a Secretlab Titan Evo; however, it does not cost anywhere near what the Titan Evo costs. I can spill coffee on the AutoFull chair and not feel any regret. If the cat jumps up on the chair, I don't check for claw marks. The footrest on the AutoFull chair is not as useful as I had hoped; however, the rocking function of the chair more than makes up for any disappointment from the footrest. After using this chair for three months, I would purchase it again.",1
"I bought this for my son, and he loves it! He says it is very comfortable. Maybe too comfortable as he occasionally falls asleep all nite in it while gaming!!!"1
"This is my 5th gaming chair. The back pillow is really soft and stays place. Pro tip, do not sit in a gaming chair wearing jeans with buttons or anything sharp.",
"The chair came to my house in a beaten up box, but none of the parts of the chair were damaged. Setting it up was easy. The cushions are nice for my butt and back. The foot rest is something I can't do without in a gaming/office chair now. I think I might be missing something for the lumbar pillow because I don't know how to secure it down. Other than that, I'm happy overall.",1
"Great chair, no back pain, easy to adjust, will be purchasing another for the office",1
"These chairs are crap. My E-Blue Gaming chair lasted for 8 years until the seat covers and padding started to decline. That's why I got a new one and decided on this brand.
"I will never go discount again. Stay away and get a Secret Labs or Razor chair."1
"I‚Äôm assuming I got one of the chairs people have been returning due to defects . The base was warped and didn‚Äôt allow me to install the leg . Support had me buy a universal base then refunded me . The base was not fitting correctly but made it work . I get to the back rest and the side seams were ripping . They need to check those returns keep the good parts and throw everything else away . Stop sending out the defective boxes !",1
"Too keep this review detailed, yet short and simple, this chair claims to have a 330 pound weight capacity. I'm well under this capacity at around 290 pounds. I received this chair early in September and immediately noticed something odd. The chair itself has a very narrow seat area that flairs out with two metal rails. These rails dug into my thighs at first and was uncomfortable until I got used to it.",1
"However, those rails would come back as important details. Early in February the right seat rail had broken. Which amusingly, made the chair more comfortable. The downside is it weakened the structural integrity of the chair. Late in February the backrest started to not support weight. Even with the chair locked in the upright position, it will lean back. It seems the right rail being compromised caused the pivot points for the backrest to strain and break. I cannot resecure the the backrest to the seat as the metal has been distorted.",1
"Simply put, this chair is not for people with a wide stature.",1
"Ok, so it's been a couple years. The surface material is starting to crack. The mount on the underside of the chair is broken so it rocks diagonally front-left to rear-right. It's never level and is uncomfortable. I'm 5'9" 160lbs by the way. I never jumped on it or anything. It was used for work/gaming.",1
"Wouldn't buy again. Ever.",0
"edit: After just over 1 year of use the seat is torn to shreds and the armrests are beginning to deteriorate. Dropped rating from 2 to 1 star. Not only would I not recommend this chair but I am personally staying away from all AutoFull products.
"The chair was easy to assemble. I am skinnier than most and it was almost too narrow for my legs. Armrests are nice. The footrest is a bit wonky and goes unused. The headrest likes to slide down and for taller people it sits too low and has to constantly be adjusted. My biggest complaint is that the seat is already ripping apart in only 6 months of ownership. Would only recommend this product if it was at least half the price.",0
"Got it to replace a 10 year old office chair, within 2 years the armrests have fallen apart and have bug chunks missing. The thin outer material of the seat started peeling off and this chair looks worse than the one I replaced it with. It is also not as comfortable as my old one and cost over 3x the price. One of the worst purchases I have ever made.",
"Bought this chair in November 2021. And it's been less then a year and the metal around the piston that holds the chair up has started cracking all the way around the piston. And know the chair leans all the way back and too the right.",1
"I bought a chair a month later for a friend's and both are chairs are starting too do the same thing. I've owned many cheap computer chairs from Walmart and have never had this happend. First time I spent 250 per chair for somthing nice it breaks. I wrote an email since there website says the chair has a 3 year warranty but I'm yet too get an email back and I'm assuming it's because I got it through Amazon. The dealer number and website provided on Amazon for this product both don't work.. so I'm sure this is there way of not having to support there product if we buy from Amazon.",1
"If you wanna buy a chair that looks good feels good but will break after less then year with out warranty this the chair for you. ALL FOR THE LOW PRICE OFF 250$",1
"I used this backpack for my international trip and boy oh boy do I wish I tested it out on a shorter trip beforehand. First off this thing looks like it could fit a lot but it can‚Äôt without looking and feeling extremely bulky. This thing carries less than the backpack I used as a kid in middle school. Secondly the water bottle holder is COMPLETELY USELESS if you have a 24 oz or 32 oz Owala. My water bottle has not been able to stay in the holder!!! It‚Äôs basically a useless feature‚Ä¶ no matter how I secure it it won‚Äôt stay put. I‚Äôve had my Osaka FLING out of the holder multiple times during this trip just from walking and turning around. Waste of money, I actually would rather use a CHILD‚ÄôS SCHOOLBAG than this for traveling.",1
"One of the cords for the charging station popped out while I was opening the product. Then when I put it back in it didn't charge anything. Then when I put it on my back and walked around my apartment both cords fell off",1
"I bought this a month ago for my trip to NYC. I actually ordered three of them (mine, husband, and daughter). Theirs are perfect fine, mine started to tear immediately. I noticed it on the plane. Update: the company reached out to me and offered to send me a new one. I am thrilled with how they handled this and replaced it. I am very impressed!!",1
"I actually thought the backpack was a little stiffer, the back part is very uncomfortable with the sneakers and clothes you wear. The truth is a little disappointing the product",1
"Absolutely no support - once you fill the bag up it‚Äôs just like wearing a saggy sack. Terrible for travel, as there‚Äôs no structure and will hurt your back. I made a huge mistake in not fully testing it before traveling. Furthermore, the packing cube it came with ripped as soon as I closed it. Sadly return window closed so I‚Äôm stuck with it.",
"Held more than enough for a four day trip with room to spare. I have trouble lifting luggage into the overhead bin, this fits nicely under the seat. Can be used as a backpack or carried like a bag. Well made with ample storage pockets. Great deal!",0
"This backpack is great! It is very lightweight but holds so much stuff! I like the different pockets and the zippers, along with the strap on the back to attach to your suitcase. The buckles also help keep everything together in the larger section. I like that it lays flat and opens like a book, but you can also open it partially to get things in/out. The straps are comfortable and easy to adjust. The phone charger outlet only seems to work with a USB-A cable, which not as many things use nowadays, so I just don‚Äôt use the cable. I had a much more expensive backpack that looked nice but didn‚Äôt last a year (and wasn‚Äôt used very often). This backpack looks great, holds a lot, and is a great price. Highly recommend!",1
"I used it for the first time this weekend! I packed a good amount of stuff in it and it held up great. Exceeded my expectations. The straps are nicely panned so although I had wait in the bag, it did not feel too heavy on my shoulders, and I can compress down once I close it by hooking the belts. It looks good. It feels good. It held up really well and I love all the compartments.
"Funny thing is when I went to leave with some of my friends one of my friends. We had the exact same bag and she loves it too.",1
"13+! These headphones are very high quality! I use them everyday! Very comfy dont pinch ur head and u can adust the head size on it! The sound quality is outstanding! Its worth the price! Their is not cord outlet to put the aux cord in its only bluetooth! I use these on my iphone 4s and it really works well! I highly recommend for 13+!",1

With its long battery life, built-in microphone, and stylish design, the JBL Tune 510BT is a fantastic choice for anyone seeking high-quality wireless headphones.",1

"Perfect fit, wonderful especially for the price, decent noise cancellation, well working buttons, easy charging, don‚Äôt break easy, and a good weight. The charging cord is a little short but it‚Äôs not too inconvenient",1

"absolutely great sound. easy setup and pairing.
"It should have a separate track finder button. the volume buttons is one touch press for raising and lowering volume, but you have to hold it down to change tracks.",1
"It can stay connected up to About 40 feet unobstructed, and a maximum about 25 ft. with walls in between device and headphones. about 4 hours nonstop battery life which, for the higher quality of sound produced compared to other Bluetooth stereo headphones, i think is more than adequate. have the headphones more than 2 years now, but only this night writing a review, its still going strong with same length battery life.",1

"great quality for the price! And a quick charge!? Easy to use for everyday. Only thing I wish was for movies the sound is a little louder. Great volume and bass for music though!",0
"The sound is clear, good volume, does not get dirty, the construction is very good, resistant, it folds up very convenient for carrying them. The battery lasts well. It works great with the cell phone's Bluetooth, it pairs without interference. The ear pad of the hearing aid is soft and doesn't bother after hours of use.",1
"Ordered these because they were on a prime day deal. Took more than 10 days to get them. Should have been my first sign, but I ignored it. Took them from the box. Charged them for several hours. No biggie there. Expect that out of the box. Did a manual connection to bluetooth on my Fire. The left side would not work. Tried to learn about balancing issues on the Fire. It didn't have anything to balance. Tried to see if the headphone had a balance option. They don't. Decided to do a deep dive on the internet and found out there are multiple videos about this exact issue for JBL headphones. That did it. I'm out. Returned them this morning. Not worth the money. Out of the box and it doesn't work? Tech support is not happening. I'll get something different.",1

"I liked the sound. If it only had lasted. It didn't. So I called the customer support number. The first guy said to hold as he was going to make a case number for me. Then we were disconnected. He had my phone number but never called back. So I called again. The woman who I worked with was very nice and we got to the part where they replace the product. They demand that you send the piece of junk back before they will replace it. Why? It's not any good to anyone. If they look at my buying history, which I'm sure they would never bother to do, they would see that I don't give one star reviews and I don't scam people asking for replacements. But...don't trust those dishonest customers. So I said forget it. I'm 74 and getting to the post office is a real hassle for me. So I said forget it. The produce was on sale, and a new model came out, so I have to ask if they weren't selling the last of a bad batch to clear their inventory.",1

"I bought these headphones for my husband because the headphone covers were worn away and I thought he would like a new set. He has used them for music before sleep and today they won't charge. I did not buy a warranty because this is JBL which used to mean it was a good product. His old pair was JBL and I have some that are JBL and they have lasted forever, but this one is a lemon! I bought these for Christmas and now it is only June and they no longer charge. Just enough time to not be able to get a refund or an exchange. I have tried different chords, different charging stations, and different power sources -no luck. Disappointed. Any recommendations for a different better headphone?",1

"I've had these before but not off of Amazon. I had previously bought mine from Walmart and I LOVED them. They've got great sound quality and very comfortable. I had to get a replacement pair and decided to get them from here. The button to turn them on doesn't work well, you have to press it very hard and at a weird angle just to get it to work. And now after them for just a short time they won't even charge. I'm super disappointed.",1

"Originally I would have highly recommended this product that we bought my 8 year old son for Christmas. He uses these for home school to listen to lessons/videos etc. Today we smelt an electrical fire smell and came to find the charger attached to the head phones scorched, smoking, and completely melted into the USB charging component of the headphone NOT at the source of the wall. I would have wanted a full refund for this dangerous product (it‚Äôs 10pm at night and thank goodness we found the source of the smell before it caught my son‚Äôs room on fire during the night). This product is a fire hazard and an electrocution hazard. Unacceptable!",1
"This water flosser is really simple to set up and start using. It feels nice to hold when using; it‚Äôs not heavy, and it‚Äôs very comfortable to hold. The flosser is also a perfect size to store in a drawer or cabinet when not in use. Great quality. It does make noise, but not more than any other brand.
"I have only used it a few times so far, so I can‚Äôt speak to the battery life, but it is very easy to charge.",1
"I love the fact that it‚Äôs waterproof so I can take it in the shower if needed.",1
"Also, customer service is very helpful & friendly.",1
"Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this brand to others.",1
"The COSLUS Water Dental Flosser is truly an outstanding oral care device! From the moment I picked it up, I could feel the sturdiness and quality, thanks to its substantial weight and solid construction. I was immediately impressed by how efficiently it works. The water pressure is excellent, and it comes with three versatile modes that cater to different needs.",1
"The first mode is the Clean mode, which I use daily to keep my teeth and gums in top condition. Since I have sensitive gums, the Soft mode has been a gentle yet effective way to ease into the experience without discomfort. The third mode, Massage, is a game-changer‚Äîit provides a thorough massage for my entire mouth, stimulating my gums and leaving my mouth feeling incredibly refreshed.",1

"To top it off, the flosser includes a tongue scraper attachment that makes it easy to clean and refresh my tongue, ensuring my whole mouth feels rejuvenated.",1

"Overall, this product has exceeded my expectations in every way. There are virtually no downsides, and the performance is top-notch. Plus, after registering my warranty, I got an additional 2 years of coverage! I highly recommend this product‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed by the quality and effectiveness of this dental appliance.",1
"This is absolutely an amazing and excellent, highly effective, attractive, and well made oral irrigating appliance! You can actually feel the quality as it has some weight to it! I was truly impressed by how well it worked! It has great pressure and 3 different modes of operation. First, it has the clean mode which is what you‚Äôd normally use on a daily basis for maintaining your dental health and hygiene. Second, it has soft mode for those with sensitive teeth and gums or while using it for the first time while you get your mouth used to it. The third mode is the massage mode where you can get a serious massage of your whole mouth including your teeth and gums. Then you can change the tip to the tongue scraper and get it cleaned and refreshed also. It‚Äôs really a whole mouth refresher! There‚Äôs really pretty much all pros and no cons that I can actually think of! After you register your warranty, you get rewarded with 2 extra years of warranty! Please just buy it! You‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised at the performance level and feel of the quality of this dental appliance!",1

"Quality is nice, several tips to choose from, easy to charge but do have to keep up with the cover for the charging port. That is a downfall because it is small. Otherwise, works great for my purposes and less bulky and cumbersome than one that has to sit on my counter.",0

"Haven‚Äôt had this flosser long and it will take time as on my first use I squirted myself in the eye, I managed to clean the bathroom ceiling with it and I sent the dog running as he thought he was about to get a bath.",1

"I have found that using it in the shower is the best way and frankly the least messy but as I get more used to it I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt be squirting everything and more importantly she who must be obeyed will be happier I‚Äôm not making a mess.",1

"It seems to be doing a great job on my teeth and they definitely feel cleaner.",0

"The downsides are the water does seem to run out quickly but it‚Äôs very easy to fill.",1

"The little plug on the front to protect the charging point is a tad irritating and is not attached to the main body so the probability of it getting lost is quite high.",1

Other than that I‚Äôm delighted with my flosser and definitely would recommend it, though not for rinsing your eye out or washing the dog üòéüê∂",1
"I was given an original Kindle Paperwhite (from 2012) a year ago, and I fell in love. It was my first Kindle. (I have had Nooks, which I loved, and various Fire tablets - I currently use a Fire HD8 Plus - over the years, too.) It was a perfect size, and I could read at night a lot better than on a tablet. The battery life wasn't that great after 10 years of use, and the response was slow, but it still worked fine overall for my needs. I have wanted to trade it in for a new one, but that isn't a "need", so I just kept waiting. Well, when I saw this Paperwhite Kids on sale for the lowest price ever - it was before Prime Day, I jumped on it, and traded in my old one (I got $5 LOL - but hey - $5 is $5!) plus a 20% off trade-in allowance, so I bought this for a song! And I am so happy that I did. Yes, it is for kids, but you can use it as an adult, too, and have two profiles - one to read your regular stuff, and a "kids" one to access the free year-long subscription stuff. I like the size and how it feels in my hand, the case is nice (black was the only color available), it's waterproof, easy to set up and use, very responsive, has no ads, and has a 2-year warranty. I don't know about the battery life yet as I have only had it for 2 days, but I hope it is as advertised. I highly recommend getting this kids version as you get a lot of bang for your buck!",1
"It‚Äôs a kindle paper white, the best e-reader available. I bought this kids edition for travel. It‚Äôs less expensive than the standard edition. It‚Äôs super light and water proof which is handy for reading by the pool or in the pool. I haven‚Äôt tried this but I know it won‚Äôt drown if I drop it. The cover is very cute and comfortable to hold and it can‚Äôt be removed. It feels pretty rugged like it can take a tumble without breaking. It‚Äôs a great replacement for my old kindle Voyage. If you don‚Äôt like the cartoon cover other colors are available.",1
"I bought this kindle for myself from a recommendation in a book group I‚Äôm in- I didn‚Äôt want to buy the newer and bigger versions but this size is perfect! I don‚Äôt see any problems with using it for adults instead of children like it‚Äôs advertised. The protective cover is awesome, and easy to hold! It stays put with a magnet which I love. I typically only use Bluetooth and wifi for it when I need to update my downloads so my battery lasts months without a charge which is awesome. It doesn‚Äôt take too long to fully charge either. It‚Äôs definitely durable as I‚Äôve gotten it a little wet here and there and it‚Äôs been fine! You can change the font size which is nice. I like to have it pretty small so it looks like a full book page. I mostly Read in the dark so I keep it on the night setting and don‚Äôt tend to use the white back ground much but it‚Äôs great that you can control the brightness of it on the dark background!",1
"I got this for myself because 1) the warranty is longer than the regular 2) it is ad-free on the sleep screen 3) it comes with a case. I don't mind the juvenile motifs on the case, it works great for me! No issues with the device itself, it has been great to have my library on the go.",1
"My granddaughter used mine to read a book on kindle and immediately wanted one of her own. I love the way I can monitor everything she‚Äôs reading and for how long she‚Äôs used the device. You can set time limits and shut off times. Plus if she wants to purchase a book I‚Äôm sent a notification so I can decide to get it or not. Big bonus was the 1-year free of Amazon kids. Also you‚Äôre able to sync your local library to your Kindle with the app Libby so digital books can be borrowed using your library card to check them out. Great purchase and way better than video games!!
You can also create multiple profiles and set age restrictions for each profile.",1

"Assembly was a bit of a pain, but I would still say it was pretty easy. After adding batteries, the toy works pretty well and my son has such a blast! It is smaller than I expected and the plastic does feel a bit cheap, but overall it‚Äôs a great toy!",0
"I thought this cash register looked cute and got it for my niece as a holiday gift. It comes with an array of accessories, including a scanner, drawers, play money, coins, credit cards, and a play food set complete with beverages, cookies, cakes, and more. It's worth noting that 2X1.5AA and 2X 1.5AAA batteries are required, though not included. The scanner emits light and sound when pressed. The real calculation function accurately calculates the price of goods and allows for payment by cash, card, or electronic means -- and you can separate it from the rest of the set. While it's not a functioning cash register, it does a lot -- I love the freezer, and there's even a drink dispenser you can fill up with water that functions just like the real thing. I love it, and I'm confident she will too!",1
"This is a very cute toy for your child. They will have hours of fun with this toy. Nice quality.",0
"This toy reminds me of a convenience store. Nonetheless, great for pretend play. It has alot of assessories and a cute scanner that makes noise each time you scam the bar code. A great item and small enough to set aside and store away when not in use.",1
"Made for young kids. Was disappointed the cash registered because it didn't open. Audio features were nothing more then identical buzzes. We have had similar toys that offer better features. Took a while to assemble all parts.",1
"Such a cute kids play kitchen set",1
"I love these eye masks. I like the variety because each color targets something different. They smell amazing and feel really great while wearing. I found they didn't slip as much as other brands I've used. I put them on while I drink coffee and do my devotion. They reduce puffiness and brighten the sensitive skin under my eyes, leaving me feeling refreshed. It my favorite way to start the day.",1
"I absolutely loved this product. I will be buying again in future. Gives me plenty to last a while also I love being able which ones i want to use that day. Either for dark under eyes or if i need hydration for my under eyes. Also, gives a clear explanation about wach color and what it helps with.
It moisturizes very well. The appearance is awesome because they are fun colors. They do not have any bad smell to any color. The smoothness is also very good",1
"The eye masks came in a well-sealed box. I use them daily in the morning and my skin under my eyes feels firm and moisturized. I have shared with my family and they also like them. The packages are easy to open and the eye masks stay put during my 30 min at home workout. I highly recommend them for their effectiveness and cost point.",1
"First timer using and under eye Product like this. Product was very easy to use and provided a lot of relief for my tired eyes. Nicely packaged product. Four options: 24k gold, Hyaluronic Acid, Rose and Aloe vera. The patches are a little thick, large and cover the entire under eye area plus a little more. I found they slide a bit but I was multitasking while I was wearing them. Maybe if I took a nice 20 minute rest they would stay in place. No foul odor or stinging solution. I didn't need to pat my under eye area because my skin just drank it up. Filled in my wrinkles and made me look a great deal more refreshed. Definitely a keeper.",0
"When you try and take these out of the packages, they don't slide out on the plastic plate, so you have to dig the package to get them. And then when you put them on your eyes, they don't stay, they fall off there, worthless, I would never ever buy these again. Ever do not recommend at all ever.",1
"Was excited to try them. Cute packaging and very cooling when applied. Unfortunately I developed discoloration under my eye where the patches burned my skin. I don't have sensitive skin and was shocked when I looked in the mirror.",1
"So these arrived, they seem fine. But the packaging is full of grammatical errors, as if a Chinese person was trying to speak English. Furthermore, there is no country of origin listed on the packaging. So I'm probably putting toilet water infused patches under my eyes. I'll likely be returning.",1
"I tried each of the different ‚Äútypes‚Äù in this assortment box. No difference whatsoever and they do not stay in place. These also do not stay put in their packaging and have to be fished out when wanting to use. I have no idea how these got so many good reviews",1
"It feels like this doesn't do anything. It feels like it is just water inside the eye patches.",1
"Burned my skin ,but feel cool for a bit.",1
"Extremely disappointed, It does absolutely nothing",1
"Two sides to every murder ‚ú®
Many thanks to Penguin Teen for the arc copy. I loved How to Survive your Murder so I hit ‚Äúrequest‚Äù so fast for this one and was not disappointed. This was a great little binge worthy, popcorn, campy thriller/slasher novel. I can just picture this as a movie. Told in dual pov and set at Camp Lost Lake 17 years later we have one girl who is trying to clear her mother‚Äôs name after being wrongfully accused of the original murders and one girl who has questions regarding her parentage. The creepy setting and the mystery surrounding the camp have been the campfire stories told about the witch responsible for the murders which gave it an extra creepy vibe. This was YA but well written an enjoyable and I couldn‚Äôt put it down. While some of it was a bit predictable it was extra twisty as is the nature of Danielle Valentine‚Äôs stories. 4.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è",1
"This book was a 5/5 star read for me! Oh my goodness, it was so good! I was drawn in from page one and read it so quickly! I didn't want to put it down and flew through it. I loved everything about this book! It was well written, the plot was extremely intriguing and well thought it. There were so many plot twists and the ending was definitely a big one! The book ended on what I feel was a plot twist and I'm already hoping for a book two! There just aren't enough words to explain how much I fell in love with this book! Danielle Valentine will be an auto buy author for me now! I will be recommending this book forever!",1
"Oh wow. What a thriller of a book this was! So many stories come together and make this book an exciting, heart pounding thriller. This is a quick read, and I could not put it down. The mystery of the lost lake witch terrifies all who hear about it, but what if this campfire story is real? This is a must read this summer!",1
"Thank you NetGalley and Penguin Teen for the copy of Two Sides to Every Murder by Danielle Valentine. All I can say is WOW! I love it when a book starts off with a bang right away instead of slowly building up to it. The first page hooked me immediately, and I didn't want to stop reading. Olivia and Reagan are great protagonists, but there were chapters where it was hard to remember whose POV I was reading. Murders, a podcast, teens and a murderer on the run, what‚Äôs not to love? The story was suspenseful and well-paced, and the characters were entrancing. Then that reveal! The ending! WOW again. You don‚Äôt have to be a YA aficionado to enjoy this book, so make sure to check it out. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5."1

"This was a very good book. I liked the sisters and how alike yet how different they were. Who really murdered the people at the camp and why. The book was suspenseful and had lots of surprises, it really left me guessing what was going on and who was killing people. It was 5 stars for me but I was going to take it down to 4 because I did not like what happened at the very end. After thinking about it, I decided when a book can have that kind of effect on you, it's because it's a good book and written well. I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.",1

"I love horror stories. The Scream franchise gives me joy. So, if you‚Äôre like me, you will devour this book. It is a well-crafted story with characters who have clear motives. It is the perfect summer read if you like slasher movies. It got so intense at times that I had to put the book down. (Similar to covering my eyes during a scary movie.) I‚Äôm off to read everything else this author has published! Thank you NetGalley, Danielle Valentine, and PENGUIN GROUP Penguin Young Readers Group for the ARC.",1

"Phew! I can see why Danielle Valentine named the book ‚ÄúTwo Sides to Every Murder‚Äù and why @barnesandnoble named it one of the best books of 2024 üòÆ‚Äçüí® It felt like more sides than two üòÇ. This story was captivating, suspenseful, and twisty. It did nothing but grab my attention from BEGINNING TO END! I felt like I was watching a horror movie by the way I couldn‚Äôt put my Kindle down. Each character played a unique role in what happened at Camp Lost Lake sixteen years ago, and I was truly invested in how their stories turned out. Danielle Valentine connected everything perfectly! I think this is one murder mystery that I didn‚Äôt try to figure out who killed who, I just read and enjoyed every bit of the story. THE ENDING THOUGH üò±üò≥ü§Ø ‚Ä¶ y'all go add this one to your TBR now ‚ÄºÔ∏è",1
"Valentine‚Äôs Two Sides to Every Murder is a campy murder/slasher type story. Sixteen years ago, the unthinkable happened at Camp Lost Lake when three people were murdered one tragic night. It looks cut and dried, but the suspect is nowhere to be found. All these years later the abandoned camp is being reopened and a group of kids from town have been hired to help clean it up. Olivia has a history with the camp, she was born there on that fateful night. She‚Äôs just found out some devastating news and she‚Äôs determined to find answers, and she‚Äôs sure that the camp is the best place to start. Reagan also has ties to the camp as it‚Äôs her mom that is the suspected killer. Reagan is headed there to get answers of her own in hopes of exonerating her mother. Someone doesn‚Äôt want them at the camp and soon dead bodies start to show up in the woods. When the two girls meet up, it‚Äôs like looking in a mirror and they soon realize there‚Äôs much more to the story of Camp Lost Lake, but with the Witch of Lost Lake terrorizing the camp, will they live long enough to find out the truth? This book is very much a YA read, which can go either way. This time it tips in the wrong direction for me. Character development was lacking and the plot had several holes in it. It definitely had potential, but in this case, it didn‚Äôt quite deliver. Thank you to Penguin and NetGalley for an ARC of this book.",1

"Very campy horror that is a fast read but was not too memorable. Olivia and Reagan, two girls trying to find out why their lives are connected to murders at Camp Lost Lake. Olivia because of DNA mysteries and Reagan because she's been on the run with her mom who has been thought to have committed the crimes. Present day, the camp is being opened under a new name, but the terror is still being brought down upon those who are there to open it. I figured out a lot of things before they were revealed, but it was interesting to find out why the murders were occurring. But the end felt really out there to me, like it really could not have happened that way."0

"I found this to be a fun, engaging YA thriller. I‚Äôm a big fan of the summer camp slasher plotline. I was sucked in right from the start. The chapters are short and the pacing is fast. The story is told through multiple POVs and flashbacks. It was a little difficult in the beginning to keep the two MFCs straight, but after a while, I was able to remember who was who. The middle third of the book started to feel a bit repetitive, but I did manage to stay engaged. A lot of cat and mouse, ie: running through the woods over and over again. Most of the twists in the book are fairly easy to guess, but the author did manage to include a couple I didn‚Äôt expect. The ending was a bit over the top and requires suspension of disbelief to enjoy. There‚Äôs also a bit of a cliffhanger that I‚Äôm still a bit confused about. Overall, this is a fun, quick, and twisty read. If you enjoy YA thrillers, then I recommend giving this one a try."1

"Veronica Roth returns after a year with her sequel to Carve The Mark, her first full length book since her world famous Divergent, The Fates Divide, and I for one loved it! The first book of the duology, CTM, received mixed reviews from critics, fans of the Divergent Series, and new readers in general. I can agree that it was rocky and a little bit below my expectations when I first purchased it, but I ultimately still liked it because I enjoyed the overall plot, the second half of the book, and the interesting narrative of the characters. In Roth's defense, though, she only had the Divergent Series under her belt, which is a totally different genre than CTM and TFD. Things were also probably strained by the epic wipe-out that the Divergent movie adaption franchise faced in 2016, setting off a box office bomb with the third movie, Allegiant, and having to cancel the fourth movie they had planned and shelve it as a possible television project.
Anyways, I think that Roth managed to totally smooth out her imperfections from CTM for it's final installment, keeping my attention the whole time, hooking me even more to the characters, and giving me a very enjoyable read,
I recommend this book to any intrigued sci-fi readers and give it four out of five stars.",1
"In love with these characters. It was wonderful. I adore all the descriptions of other planets, so imaginative and really immerses me in another world (which is what I want when I'm reading to escape reality haha). Also the plot twists caught me by surprise!! Usually I see them coming a mile away. Very cool.",1

"I was a little bit disappointed in this series when I finished. I read through it all and wanted to love it but it felt like something kept holding me back from fully buying into the story. The universe Roth created was such a fantastic place to dive into and expand upon but not enough was learned in this series.

What I liked:
- The idea of the current is such an interesting and unique idea. It was cool that everyone had somewhat unique abilities that we're overpowered and take precedence over the story.
- The two main planets in the story Ogra and Thuvhe (Urek) were well thought out with interesting visuals.
- Through all of my dislikes I still liked both Cyra & Akos at the end.
- Roth did a very good job of writing from different points of view, I feel like different points of view is very hit or miss and Roth nailed it.
Having read through the Divergent series, I was sorely disappointed with how ‚ÄúAllegiant‚Äù turned out. (Hell, I‚Äôm sure a lot of people were, which is probably why Veronica Roth wrote the novella epilogue ‚ÄúWe Can Be Mended‚Äù - and that too was a disappointment. But I digress‚Ä¶) So it was with some trepidation that I started reading ‚ÄúCarve the Mark‚Äù and was so sucked into it that when I started to read ‚ÄúThe Fates Divide,‚Äù I was a bit worried that the book would end up like ‚ÄúAllegiant‚Äù did. Fortunately, Roth gets the landing right, even if it is a bit on the wistful side. Old characters are expanded upon, new ones are introduced, and there‚Äôs even a bit of political intrigue thrown into the mix. And‚Ä¶ Roth even throws in a few swears every so often, which surprised me as she didn‚Äôt do that in the Divergent series, at least as I recall. Maybe it‚Äôs a sign of her becoming a bit of a better writer? Anyhow, this series is only a duology, so give it a chance when you can!
I was actually eager to read this despite the fact Carve The Mark didn‚Äôt greatly impress me. I sat down and was immediately hooked by Eijeh‚Äôs POV. Veronica has decided to write this book from Akos‚Äôs, Cyra‚Äôs, Eijeh‚Äôs and Cisi‚Äôs POV. The latter was what made me close the book. If I wanted to read a story with a lesbian relationship - one that is now openly so, and acted upon - I would have purposefully sought out a story with that plot line.

I skipped to the end of the book and it seems that the ending has been executed better than Allegiant‚Äôs was, and she also added a plot twist that was very clever and would have been great to read. It seems Carve the Mark lacked in the areas that it did because she was setting up to tell the real story in Fate‚Äôs Divide, and I speculate her writing likely improves.

Just a word for parents who may be considering letting their kids read this series, (or for anyone else for that matter.) The relationship with Cisi and Isae is prominent, a central part to the story, and there is a scene where they are alone together, so you know exactly where it is heading. At that point I decided to stop reading.
Very easy to operate. A tip for every use you need.
These Water Flosser Tip Replacement Heads are quite versatile, fitting a wide range of flossers. I'm genuinely pleased with my purchase, as they've proven to be a convenient solution for maintaining oral hygiene. While they offer different types to accommodate various needs, I've found that most of them aren't particularly useful for me; I primarily stick to using the standard flosser tip. My only complaint is about the packaging; I wish it were more durable or better designed to keep the replacement heads organized and protected. Overall, though, these replacement heads have been a valuable addition to my dental care routine.",
"These are very good quality replacement heads. They are exactly the same as the original ones that came with my irrigator.",0

"Having previously received 'Only Compatible COSLUS' replacement tips, I was pretty confident that these replacements would fit my F5025 perfectly, and they do. While COSLUS sells a F502* Series, including the F5020E and F5029A, my F5025 is branded as Nicwell. The Nicwell flosser and the COSLUS tips (and the packaging) seem to be all from the same manufacturer. I'm disappointed that COSLUS is not currently including the U shaped tip, which is so much better at getting the backs of my lower teeth.",1

"These water flosser replacement heads were a perfect fit for my water flosser! Highly recommend!",1

"These tip replacements come individually wrapped in one box. They only fit the COSLUS water flosser. They are good replacements and work as intended. Handy to have a few extra in case you leave some at a hotel by accident.",0

"These did not fit my COSLUS flosser like it stated.",1

"As a frequent traveler, staying organized is key, and the 8 Piece Compression Packing Cubes Set from Focus Design delivers just that. This deluxe set includes 2 large, 1 medium, and 2 small compression cubes, alongside a laundry/shoe bag and 2 accessory bags, all neatly designed in vibrant Hot Pink. Made from ultra-strong twill fabric, these cubes are not only water-resistant but also durable and washable, ensuring they withstand the rigors of travel. The double capacity design expands to accommodate more than just essentials, while the sleek zipper closure keeps everything secure. Whether it's a weekend getaway or a longer adventure, these cubes keep your suitcase tidy and your essentials easily accessible. Ideal for travelers seeking both style and functionality, this set is a must-have for seamless packing and stress-free journeys."

"Super nice quality, and they compress so small, and grow so big. I can fit everything I need, and they‚Äôre super lightweight. I got these for my sisters and they have not complained one bit. They look amazing and perform great. I recommend to everyone!",1

"Excellent, my suitcase stayed organized and easy for me to pack and unpack.",0

"I didn‚Äôt think these would fit much and actually zip shut. I was wrong. I put about 15 small garments in the smallest bag and it easily zipped and compressed to about an inch thick. I didn‚Äôt even fold them and I could‚Äôve fit more. The compression zippers are thick and feel heavy duty. The bag fabric feels like good quality and they look nice and sleek. The handles are a nice add."1

"I have five children, so we have tried various brands of packing cubes along the way and have one set of these. I like the variety and the sizes, but the thicker ones are a bit awkward and really too awkward for most suitcases and I find little purpose in, the zip closure as these have so much room in them. They do not condense enough. I think they would be best for a very large suitcase and perhaps you could then see the benefit but definitely not for children‚Äôs clothes."1

"Crisp prints that are very functional, and easy to connect."1

"The printer is a very efficient, portable model. It is also really simple to install. I use it as a printer for invoices."1

"I love these I‚Äôve ordered them twice and am on my second set of 200 sheets. As a first year teacher these have been beyond helpful for getting work done outside the classroom. I honestly will probably order another set soon. Great quality, easy to use. The best bang for your buck. I prefer these sheets over the ones that came with my machine. These ones are thicker and more durable and leave a great finish on them. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about them!"0

"I am a teacher and laminate all the time I use these every day. That said, I can buy one pack and it will last me most of the school year. There is no difference between these and the name brands, they heat and seal perfectly and are sturdy and don‚Äôt separate (unless the students actively peel them off of course üôÉ). But I don‚Äôt have to run them through twice like I did with the name brand ones, so I would highly recommend they will last you forever and they work great!"1

"These work great with my personal laminator. The pockets are easy to open to put your item inside."1

"These laminating sheets provide excellent protection for my important documents, offering a clear and sturdy finish that enhances durability. They work seamlessly with my thermal laminator, ensuring a smooth and consistent seal every time. The 3 mil thickness strikes a good balance between flexibility and rigidity, making them suitable for various uses, from preserving photos to protecting recipes. While they do sometimes require trimming around the edges, this small extra step is worth the professional-looking results. Overall, they are a reliable and high-quality choice for anyone looking to safeguard their paper items."0

"I bought this back in 2020 and finally ran out and repurchased it and it‚Äôs a completely different product. My kids were helping me laminate their school stuff and they both were so frustrated and noticed the difference immediately. Now the papers inside that I‚Äôm trying to laminate move around so easily which is a problem when laminating many and smaller pieces‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like a race to see if I could fix it before it goes through the laminator. And let me tell a few times I lost and pieces were overlapping and ruined. Laminating is already super tedious so this added issue makes it double the work. Hoping they at least allow me to return and give refund even though I‚Äôve used it. I‚Äôll let you know if that‚Äôs a problem. Just wanted give a heads up about the moving thing. Not fun."1

"I'm not one to write negative reviews, but I feel I have to on this item. I bought this item because it was rated at 4.8 stars, but after using it I'm not sure who was rating it. I bought in April 2024 because I had run out of my normal brand of laminating pouches, and I felt the price was great and I would need them for this fall soccer season. Unfortunately, I didn't open the package until now (8/16/24) prepping for the soccer season, so it is after the time that I can return it so in the trash they will go! The plastic is very clear (the only positive), but the edges curl and the middle waves. It looks very unprofessional. It looks as if I ran them through the washer/dryer. I will never buy these again!"1

"I bought this product for my classroom to laminate important papers and projects. I tried this paper on two different settings and both times it curled up on the edges and got stuck in the laminator. I tried a few different ways to make it work until it finally got fully stuck in the laminator. It took me a while to get it out. I have so many pieces left that are utterly useless."0

"Very cute, great quality. Comes with an extra chain strap. It‚Äôs light, comfortable, and the black looks very nice."1

"Very cute, great quality. Comes with an extra chain strap. It‚Äôs light, comfortable, and the black looks very nice."1

"So cute and simple. It goes with everything and has a surprising amount of room in it. It includes two chains, one longer gold chain and the other is a short white one. Really versatile purse!"1

"Adorable small shoulder bag. Well made/easy to zip."0

"Cute, small, love the option of a longer chain! Fits my essentials and overall a good buy."1

"I do like this bag for an everyday random bag to carry around. I had a similar style to this one for a couple of years and noticed the hardware had tarnished, so I wanted to replace it and ended up going with this one. You get what you pay for, of course - the zipper doesn‚Äôt always work the way I‚Äôd like it to and it doesn‚Äôt look super amazing quality, but it works for a casual everyday bag!"1

"If this is for a night or two go for it but definitely not a daily bag. The zipper is awful. But the size is perfect. Looking for this in a better quality."1

"I was very disappointed in this handbag because it was not as shown. I was expecting the shoulder strap to have the chain links on each side as was shown in the advertisement. The strap I received was solid down to the hooks. The reason I bought this handbag to begin with was because the small shoulder strap with the chain link ends made the purse look very dressy and I wanted to carry it to a wedding I will be attending. The other issue for me was the zipper had a very ugly long end which was not well sewn and stuck up in the air when the bag was zipped. In the picture, that end is not visible. I tried tucking it down inside the bag but because the zipper was not well sewn to the fabric, there was a visible gap when the zipper was closed. It really is a cute little bag, very soft, and quite a lovely shape but because of the issue with the smaller strap and the ugly zipper end, I had to return this item."1

"Bought this for a wedding after looking everywhere and this bag is gorgeous! Can‚Äôt beat the price, fits my iPhone max which is a plus. I used it as a clutch but it also has a chain so it‚Äôs very versatile. I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money for a bag I would probably use only once or twice. Perfect color and great quality! Looks expensive!"1

"Love this budget-friendly clutch. I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I love it! This little gem has quickly become my go-to accessory for nights out and special occasions. Despite its affordable price tag, the quality is impressive ‚Äì the material feels durable, and the stitching is sturdy. Plus, the design is super chic and versatile, making it easy to pair with any outfit. I love that it's spacious enough to hold all of my essentials, like my phone, keys, and lipstick, without feeling bulky or overcrowded. And the best part? It looks way more expensive than it actually is! I've received so many compliments on it already. If you're in need of a stylish clutch purse that won't break the bank, look no further ‚Äì this budget-friendly option is an absolute steal!"0

"Last minute purchase for a black-tie event, bought with the intention of just using once but it‚Äôs actually far sturdier and nicer than I expected and I look forward to using it again. It‚Äôs a lovely neutral champagne tone, goes best with gold accessories because of the hardware but would be OK with cooler toned outfits too. It‚Äôs hard to find elegant clutches that will fit my larger phone (S23 Ultra) this had plenty of room for lip gloss, keys etc while still closing very securely and comfortable enough to hold one-handed. The included chains are a bit cheap-looking but otherwise thrilled with the purchase."

"This bag was everything I needed. The champagne color is very nice, the design and size are perfect. The clasp works pretty well and it can fit quite a bit. Do not hesitate buying if you are considering it."

"Really beautiful bag for weddings. I was not expecting the quality to be as nice as it is for what I paid. Style is beautiful and it fit my phone, keys, and lipstick with room to spare. Highly recommend."

"I bought this for my daughter's wedding. It is absolutely gorgeous and very well made."

"I got this item for a gala since I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money. It looks very nice for the occasion and it looks very good overall!"

"I was excited to receive this clutch, but I have to admit I was a bit disappointed when I saw it in person. The material looked cheaper than I expected based on the photos online. While the design is nice, the overall quality didn't quite meet my expectations."

"Pretty silver purse. I chose it for the fastener that resembles a branch, but the fastener is difficult for me to open. Returned."

"The purse really had very little color and I was looking for something to be really gold or blush rose to match my dress. Looked like a nice product but didn't meet my needs so I returned it."

"Cute but yet to use so we‚Äôll see. As of now it looks good."

"Would have loved the purse but it had a stain on it when I opened it. I am returning."

"These mugs are an excellent quality and are quite attractive. They have a lovely glaze finish which really adds to their nice touch. They are not too heavy but are a sturdy and durable quality and feel great when you hold them. I hand wash my dishes, including these mugs, with warm water, a sponge, and dish soap and have had no issues. They are a great size for coffee or tea. I really like that they are dishwasher and microwave safe -- huge plus!"
"This coffee cup set of 4 is great for lattes, tea, and more. Each mug is durable and scratch-resistant. Safe for dishwasher and microwave use. The handmade brown rim adds a vintage touch. A nice gift option for special occasions."

"These 14 oz. mugs are the perfect size for morning coffee, afternoon tea, or a cozy hot chocolate. I ordered the Lagoon Blue color, which is a classy shade and especially beautiful with its high-quality glaze. The smooth finish is comfortable to hold and to drink from. I found this seller to be very reputable. One of the cups arrived with a small flaw on its handle, and the seller responded promptly to my email and replaced the mug in a very timely fashion."

"I ordered these mugs in white and they are just beautiful. They have an organic, modern farmhouse aesthetic and feel sturdy and durable (I've already run them through the dishwasher without any incident). The glaze is just right (not too glossy, not matte either) and the dark rim detail adds a lovely rustic modern touch and visual interest. They feel great in your hand and have a very comfortable grip (I'm SUPER picky about this aspect). If I could change anything about them, I would make them so they have a slightly larger capacity, for those of us who like to make cappuccinos and lattes (the frothed milk requires a little more space than a regular coffee). But they are a standard American coffee cup size, so they're not undersized by any means. Also great for tea or hot chocolate. They are so beautiful and well made that I plan to use them daily, so it would be wonderful to have matching saucers. I will need to look at the brand to see if they make saucers to match that I can purchase separately ü§û"

"Nice quality. The finish is a good quality finish. The handles feel great, and the size of the mugs is great for coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc."

"Nice quality. The finish is a good quality finish. The handles feel great, and the size of the mugs is great for coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc."

"I wanted a new set of coffee mugs about this size so decided to give them a try. They are well made but the one thing I don't really like is that the lip of the mug is uneven. It makes it a bit weird to drink from it and some of them are a bit uncomfortable. Other than that, the colors look great and the handle is comfortable."

"I am a makeup lover and when it comes to a full glam or a natural beat, this setting spray is top tier. I have been using this one for 2 years now consistently. I definitely recommend if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin as well. I recommend it to a lot of people and so many people ask me how my skin looks so glowy and healthy with makeup on. I have very dry skin as well, so this hydrating formula really helps my skin out. Give it a try and you won‚Äôt be disappointed :) Also smells good."

"Gives a good glow and sets your makeup all day."

"It's the best product I've found to give you an all-day glow. It really works and I will always use it."

"This product feels smooth when used with a brush. It gives you a pleasant glow and I would buy it again!"

"Really adds a nice touch to your makeup. Great healthy glowing look."

"I‚Äôm 68 and I absolutely love this spray! Creates a nice dewy look. I‚Äôve received many compliments on my skin after using this product. Subtle but effective."

"The bottle that I received seemed to be legit, as the product looked and smelled exactly like the bottle that it replaced. Girlfriend likes to use it from time to time because of the sparkle and pleasant smell."

"I haven't had it long but I like it so far. It seems to help with my dull-looking complexion."

"This product gives the perfect finish to any makeup. It gives a perfect glow!"

"The consistency of this was so watery and thin, it was very difficult to apply on my face. Also, I feel for the quality of it, it is priced too high."

"It gives your skin that glowy wet look! Very minimal sparkle!"

"Not really impressed. Purchased this because I ran out of my usual Urban Decay All Nighter setting spray. This was more expensive and doesn‚Äôt work nearly as well. It adds a little sparkle but that‚Äôs it. You can get that from your makeup itself. It‚Äôs definitely overpriced! Will not purchase again. Will go back to my usual Urban Decay."

"The bottle is smaller than I expected. The spray on this is also SUPER strong. I'm going to transfer it to a better spray bottle. If I spray it in my palms and press on my face, it's very pretty, just not functional."

"I expected more."

"Just like spraying sparkles on your face. It would probably be cuter at night so the light will catch on your face nicely, but it‚Äôs kind of allie for daytime facial application."

"Very poorly presented, watered-down."

"I got a sample of this product from ULTA and it was mixed well and didn‚Äôt separate. When I received this order, the glitter and everything separated from the liquid. It works fine if you shake it well, but it wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting."

"This dress is so cute -- it's an occasion dress, best for events & special occasions."

"It's a lovely dress! Do I think it's worth the ~$100 price tag? I guess that's up to you. It is nice, but I've bought actual qipao with really nice fabric that didn't cost this much. This is a polyester/viscose blend, not silk brocade. If it were half the price, it would seem more equitable. I will say the fit is quite nice and is flattering on my 5' 105 lb frame. I will be wearing it for the next semi-fancy/formal occasion. I would strongly suggest additional colors to the manufacturer as the color choice of one is limiting. The sleeves are an interesting newer feature that I have not seen before and I'm not mad about it at all. The rosette pattern with the blingy closure is probably the most fancy part of the dress as it does give the whole thing an elevated appearance; an interesting departure from the typical frog closure. I guess this is intended to modernize it but I will admit that I'm partial to the traditional buttons myself. All in all, a pretty dress for various party occasions only true downside being the price."

"I was initially worried that the dress wouldn't fit as I'm currently 6 months pregnant. I ordered the XXL which (according to the tag) is equivalent to a US 14, UK 18. The dress fits beautifully and I couldn't be happier. I'm very busty, US 34H pre-pregnancy and currently 36H, so I would typically wear a size 14 dress to accommodate my bustline. This one has a little bit of stretch and doesn't feel too snug or fitted. The fabric is soft and the rose pattern is simple yet cute. I love the cheongsam/qipao style and the puff sleeves and flutter hem add a little something different from your typical qipao. The dress is well made with not a loose thread or uneven stitch in sight. The $99 price is a bit high as I've never heard of this brand, so I don't have a frame of reference for their quality and standards."

"This dress has a beautiful, modern, elegant design and I really love how it looks on. Fits great - true to size, comfortable, soft. The puff sleeves and subtle flowy cut at the bottom of the dress look very well done and are so flattering without looking too much. Love the black sparkly detail and the length. Overall, am very happy with this dress. I have other pieces from this brand, 'Goelia,' that also look very stylish, pretty & well-made, so I am now a big fan of this brand as well!"

"Great quality dress, it looks just like on the model. The fabric doesn't offer much stretch but it's true to size."

"When this GOELIA Cheongsam Short Puff Sleeve Mini Dress arrived, I was disappointed as it didn't look like it was going to fit me. But I figured I'd try it on just to see how tight it was. Boy was I wrong! It fit like a glove! And instantly I fell in love with it! This dress is sooo pretty! It's definitely very well made and the fabric is rich. Yes, it can be worn to a more casual wedding, but I'd prefer to wear it to a special occasion dinner, etc. My only complaint, and it's a big one, is that the back hem raises up a bit due to my butt. The problem is I don't have a big or full butt, so that should definitely not be happening. It's a mistake on the part of the manufacturer. They should have allowed for a 1-inch longer back hem to accommodate a woman's butt."
"I got this for my daughter. She's about to go to high school, where for the first time in her school life, she won't have to wear uniforms. This dress is perfect. It could be worn to a dance, an interview, or the theater. It has a lot of style with the little cutouts in the front and sparkly embellishments, yet remains modest. My kid looks beautiful in it and actually seems to like it. The only things I would change would be the price (a bit high) and the bottom hem, which has an extra layer that seems unnecessary."

"The SUNZEL flare leggings have quickly become a favorite in my wardrobe. They combine the comfort of traditional activewear with a stylish, flared design. The fabric is soft and stretchy, offering a snug fit that moves with me throughout the day without losing its shape. The high-waisted design provides excellent support and a flattering silhouette, making them versatile for workouts or casual outings. The flare detail adds sophistication and style. They hold up well in the wash, maintaining their color and elasticity. Overall, a fantastic addition to any wardrobe."

"Although this item is described as PJs, I purchased it to wear out. It can definitely be styled with cute shoes and jewelry for an outing. I ordered a large for a more relaxed look, and it fit perfectly. The fabric is light and breathable, making it great for summer. I love the black set and plan on getting other colors. For $20, it's a good deal. I recommend it for casual wear, whether you're a mama or not."

"Great price for a two-piece set; I got it on sale for $15. Good quality, color as expected from the pictures, very soft and lightweight. Perfect for summer. I'm 5'6" and around 200 lbs, bought a large which fits oversized as I like. It also has pockets, which is a bonus."

"Holy crap, I love these! They are so comfortable, light, and flattering. I‚Äôm between sizes, so I went up for a little extra room. No regrets. The shorts are a great length, better than most similar sets. The top is so comfortable it feels like nothing (in a good way). Can‚Äôt recommend this set enough. I think I need two more colors‚Ä¶ or four üòâ."

"These pajamas do not look like they do in the stock image. They are not cute, and the shorts are very long."

"Comfy enough, but has the weirdest smell, like something burning. Not a fan."

"I recently purchased this black long sleeve top, and I am absolutely thrilled with it! The fabric is incredibly soft and feels luxurious against the skin. It‚Äôs the right thickness, offering warmth without being too heavy. The fit is flattering and sleek. It can be dressed up or worn casually. The color is rich and maintains its quality after washes. Overall, this top is a perfect blend of comfort, style, and quality ‚Äì a must-have for any closet!"

"I haven't received a review for this item yet."

"I haven't received a review for this item yet."

"I haven't received a review for this item yet."

"I haven't received a review for this item yet."

"This is so comfy! It stretches out nicely but returns to its original size. It feels the same as Skims and is very flattering. Will be purchasing more!"

"The material is good; the fit was a bit snug, but it looks nice and is very soft and comfy. I'm 5 ft, 126 lbs, and ordered a Medium."

"Super tight and stretchy."

"I have the same issues with these as with the short sleeve tees. Some colors are great, but some have irritating tags that can‚Äôt be removed without damaging the seam. The white one I just received has a scratchy tag on the collar and an itchy tag sewn into the seam. Really irritated with this brand for inconsistencies."

"I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and weigh 145 pounds. I normally wear a medium. I bought a large based on reviews saying it ran small. It was very tight and shows every bulge. I would only purchase this shirt if you have a very flat tummy and would recommend sizing up a couple of sizes. I‚Äôm returning the shirt."

"I purchased from this brand about a year ago and loved it for its softness and long sleeves. However, the recent order is not the same in material or sleeve length. Definitely returning."

"At first, I really liked this product in white. It was thick, stretchy, had long arms, and was not see-through. However, after a few wears and washes of the black version, the dye stained my armpits and my $55 tan Skims bra. The stain hasn't come out despite several washes. For this reason, I would not recommend."

"I am only 5'3 and about 125-130 lbs and could not get one arm into it. I had to pay $6.99 for a return label and provide my own box. Thankfully, my 11-year-old niece can fit into this, so it's not a complete waste."
"One of the sleeves was like 3 inches shorter than the other. Don't get me wrong, the fabric is soft, but it felt really weird with the sleeves being 2 different lengths, so I decided to return it after taking a look and noticing a big difference in sleeve lengths."

"I WAS ANTICIPATING TAKING THIS WITH ME ON VACATION, BUT THE SCENT DID NOT LAST. I'M NOT SURE IF THE PRODUCT HAD BEEN PRIOR OPEN, BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEND IT BACK AND REQUEST A REFUND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. LINDA DINUZZO"

"I purchased this because I was looking for an affordable VANILLA scented cologne/body spray. I've used Victoria's Secret scents in the past (Oh how I wish they'd bring back Amethyst!) so I decided to give the Bare Vanilla a try. I've tried it twice...it smells nothing like vanilla....and it is NOT returnable so I am now out nearly $20 for something I won't wear. I DO NOT recommend this AT ALL!"

"I bought this because someone told me it repels bugs, and I thought that would be better than wearing bug spray when I'm out gardening. Well, I didn't wind up trying it in the garden. It arrived and I sniffed it. It's disgusting and doesn't smell anything like vanilla. It smells like burnt sugar. I'm pretty sure it will repel bugs, because it also repels people. I will not be wearing this!"

"To buy this perfume I was guided by the rankings and I really regret doing it. The smell is strong, and gives you a headache and nauseous. I'm a big fan of vanilla perfumes, but I don't like this one in particular. Hopefully I can return it."

"The scent is absolutely amazing and it makes me think there's fresh baked goods nearby! I got the lavender vanilla first thinking I would like it more and I do really like it but omg bare vanilla smells soooo nice. It can last all day depending on how you apply!"

"I just bought this not even a month, literally three weeks ago. I‚Äôm already out of it and need to get more. Constantly getting compliments. The scent lasts a very long time; it doesn‚Äôt die down. The scent is not overpowering like other body sprays."

"Bought this recently for my wife and we both love it. Sometimes similar scents are too fake smelling or smell too sweet, this one strikes a nice balance and goes a really long way for the price. The smell lasts a long time but you can stretch it even further if you put a little Vaseline on your neck or wrists before you spray it on!"

"I use this along with the matching body wash and not to brag but... I smell SO good. The product arrived in great shape with no leaks. Easily giftable. Super yummy scent."

"Long lasting, yet not overpowering vanilla scent. Very happy with this purchase. Also, the lid is quite satisfying to place back on."

"Smells amazing.. a little vanilla and a little woodsy.. lasts a long time. One of my favorites! Would recommend."

"If you love the smell of vanilla, you will absolutely LOVE this spray. It's a beautiful scent, light but lasting. I wear it practically every day. I LOVE it! And I highly recommend!"

"I bought this for my daughter; it smells amazing. She also loves it."

"The Mechanical Pencil Set is a real winner! The pencils are easy to clean and come in beautiful, very girly colors that my daughter absolutely loved. They're lightweight and versatile, making them a great value for the money. The ease of use adds to their appeal, and they‚Äôre just adorable overall. Highly recommend this set for both its charm and functionality!"

"Everything you need in one case, love the colors, easy to use, comes with a storage case, writes good. Great value!"

"This Candies Cute Mechanical Pencil Set is everything. It comes with 6 pencils in vibrant pastel colors, 3 different lead sizes, 9 eraser refills, 3 regular erasers, and 60pcs (x2) of each lead size refill containers. The lead to paper contact is smooth! Which is a writer‚Äôs/artist‚Äôs dream. The price is perfect, but the durability of the products makes it seem like it would be more expensive. I will be ordering again!"

"Super cute colors, love the feel of the pencil and how it writes. The eraser is hidden so it won't easily get lost plus there are a lot of extra refills. Would definitely purchase again."

"I'm not sure where the small erasers go but, I was worried about the big ones being the stupid erasers that didn't erase anything and ripped the paper. I'm happy to announce that they are good erasers, no tearing, and I cannot see my mess up!"

"This is adorable, wish the case was a liiiiitle easier to open but it makes it hard for my son to get into so I'm not mad at it üòπ I'll probably be getting a few of these to replace all my pencils to be honest."

"This is adorable, wish the case was a liiiiitle easier to open but it makes it hard for my son to get into so I'm not mad at it üòπ I'll probably be getting a few of these to replace all my pencils to be honest."

"The pencils are extremely cheaply made and while they come with replacement pencil top erasers, you cannot get full use out of them. Once your eraser gets close enough to the rim of insertion, you have to replace it. Otherwise, you‚Äôll never be able to remove the current one or it‚Äôll be a battle‚Äîone you‚Äôll likely lose every time. The internal spring mechanisms are defective and, at some point, will not release the lead for you to write with from the tip."

"I bought for my tween daughter who loved it. She used it for about a month and then I saw she stopped using it. She said it doesn‚Äôt work anymore. I tried to reload the lead thinking that was the problem but you couldn‚Äôt reload the lead. All were broken. They wouldn‚Äôt load or unload. My daughter is careful with her stuff. She said, 'Mom, it‚Äôs junk.' She is right."

"I was really excited to get these pencils and have a case for them as I usually lose all my mechanical pencils. I received them, they are so cute BUT every single one of them, after taking notes for 20 minutes, the metal tip ends up just falling off. Making it impossible to write with. It‚Äôs a complete shame that every pencil in this case has that issue because I want to like them but they are unusable after 20 minutes."

"The design is nice and very equipped, but one pencil broke the chalk and then the other one came off and the other pencil fell off. The tip lasted for about two weeks in good condition and then they were ruined. Two pencils still work; I don't know if I had the bad luck that they came out in bad condition."

"„Äê360pcs Upgraded Resin Lead„ÄëThe pencil lead is made of high-quality resin and graphite which is more strong, durable, and smooth. 6 tubes of lead refill, 360pcs in total, enable you to use for a long time."

"I love the tabs that can be personalized. It is sturdy and yet just the right size."

"Sturdy, helps you keep organized, and fairly priced."

"The book looks exactly as pictured. The cover is sturdy."

"Nice notebook."

"I'm a nurse, and this little notebook is just perfect to carry around."

"This notebook is exactly as described, sheets are strong and wide. Love it. Definitely will be buying more."

"This product is great! I am in nursing school and it helps me a lot to keep everything organized. The removable dividers and everything are great to section out your notes between tests, among other things. I highly recommend!"

"Not sure how this notebook is made, but it literally falls apart. While turning the pages they come loose in your hand. I have so many important notes that I have to somehow try and keep track of on loose papers. SUPER INCONVENIENT. My advice: go more old school because the binding technique they used doesn't work."

"This is advertised as college ruled which is what I need. However, it is wide ruled. Now I have to buy new notebooks."

"Really not clear that this is not a regularly sized 5 subject notebook!"

"The springs are not good so the back cover falls off consistently."

"My ten-month-old ripped the book apart before I had the chance to use it. Extremely fragile and easy to break. Once the stem breaks a little there‚Äôs no going back so be extremely careful with this product!"

"During Prime Days last month, I ordered three different collagen sheet masks to try since I've been seeing them ALL over social media and curiosity finally got the better of me. This was easily my favorite of the three I tried."

"I stalked these for SO LONG!,1. My only gripe is that people say they‚Äôre easy to sleep in and those must be back sleepers because I couldn‚Äôt even fall asleep out of concern the mask would fall off.,1. So I just wore it for 4 hours then took it off before bed.,1. It makes your skin so bouncy and vibrant.,1. It fits really good and stays put.,1. I am going to try to sleep in it but I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶.,0. Good value for 4 masks that really do what they say.,1"

"I never really paid much attention to my skin care routine until recently.,1. For years, I neglected my skin, thinking it wasn‚Äôt that important.,1. But as I got older and started noticing more issues like dryness and dullness, I realized how crucial it is to take care of my skin.,1. I wanted to do everything I could to prevent skin problems and look amazing.,1. That‚Äôs when I discovered BIODANCE Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask and EVIL GOODS Whipped Beef Tallow and Honey Balm.,1. These two products have completely transformed my skin, and I feel like I finally understand the importance of proper skincare.,0"

"I‚Äôm so impressed!,1. I was really doubtful that these would actually stay (or comfortably stay) throughout the night.,1. They do!,1. When you wake you peel them off and feel like a dewy skin god.,1. It‚Äôs really satisfying.,1. I would say that the feeling of hydration remains for about a week for me.,1. Although they are pricey I think they are worth it for the occasional special facial.,0"

"I've tried this mask both overnight and for 4 hours, each time it delivers amazing results.,1. My skin feels plump and moisturized.,1. My pore size is visibly smaller and my skin radiant.,1. I now receive this monthly as a subscription.,1. I use this every Saturday!,1. The mask melts onto your face.,1. I've had no issues with tears or slipping.,1. Do be gentle while handling though.,1. I'm a side sleeper and I put the mask on about an hour before bed and it stays on until morning.,1. The mask is like a thin slimy sheet but leaves little residue on your fingers after putting it on.,1. I was hesitant about the price at first but after using these I think it's worth the investment.,0"

"I was skeptical about the price and the claims.,1. I received a few samples and finally took the plunge.,1. So far, I am impressed.,1. The masks are super hydrating and leave my skin feeling soft and plump.,1. I haven‚Äôt noticed any breakouts or irritation.,1. I will definitely be buying more.,0"

"This mask has a great feel and fit.,1. It didn‚Äôt slip off my face and the serum didn‚Äôt burn my skin.,1. I actually felt the serum absorbed into my skin over the course of wearing the mask.,1. My skin felt really soft afterwards.,1. I‚Äôm interested in trying out the other products from this brand.,0"
